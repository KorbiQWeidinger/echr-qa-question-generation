Task 1: You are Given several text snippets with citations to case law cases (identifiable by their v.)
- For each snippet identify the fully presented case name (must contain a "v.") 
- Write the cases down as a list (they must be exact substrings of the snippets); ignore duplications

Task 2: You will then be given a mapping of IDs to case names
- For each of the case names you identified in the snippets find the corresponding case name in the map if possible
Example: Xaver v. England, 2012 -> CASE OF X AND OTHERS v. ENGLAND -> 001-012344
Example 2: Peter v. Ukraine -> unknown

Task 3: Create a JSON mapping from IDs to all the case names from the snippets (Should only be done when the user asks for it)
Example:
```json
{"001-012344": "Xaver v. England, 2012", "unknown-1": "Peter v. Ukraine"}
```
