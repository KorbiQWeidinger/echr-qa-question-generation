      "1. As provided by Article 1, the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State is confined to “securing” (“reconnaître” in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own “jurisdiction”. “Jurisdiction” within the meaning of Article 1 is a threshold criterion. The exercise of jurisdiction is a necessary condition for a Contracting State to be able to be held responsible for acts or omissions imputable to it which give rise to an allegation of the infringement of rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], 2012, § 103, and the case-law therein).\n",
      "2. In the Convention context, the term jurisdiction in English (in French sometimes “compétence” and sometimes “juridiction”) has two separate but related senses. The first corresponds to the Court’s own jurisdiction (compétence) on the basis, in particular, of Articles 19 and 32 of the Convention, to receive an application and examine it. For that purpose it needs to establish its jurisdiction ratione personae (ascertaining for example whether, in the context of an individual application, an applicant may be regarded as a “victim” for the purposes of Article 34), and its jurisdiction ratione materiae (ascertaining for example whether the right relied upon is protected by the Convention and protocols thereto and whether the facts complained of fall within its scope). The Court has repeatedly pointed out that it must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it and is therefore obliged to examine the question of its jurisdiction at every stage of the proceedings (see, for example, Slovenia v. Croatia (dec.) [GC], 2020, or Svetova and Others v. Russia, 2023, §§ 23-28). The second sense relates to the jurisdiction (juridiction) of the High Contracting Parties, given that Article 1 obliges them to secure to “everyone within their jurisdiction” the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention (Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec.), 2022, §§ 503-505). This guide will refer to jurisdiction in the latter sense.\n",
      "3. Historically, the text drawn up by the Committee on Legal and Administrative Affairs of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe laid down, in what was to become Article 1 of the Convention, that “member States [should] undertake to secure to everyone residing in their territories the rights ...”. The Committee of Intergovernmental Experts which examined the Consultative Assembly’s draft decided to replace the words “residing in their territories” with “within their jurisdiction”. The reasons for that amendment are described in the following extract from the Collected Edition of the Travaux Préparatoires of the European Convention on Human Rights: “The Assembly draft had extended the benefits of the Convention to ‘all persons residing within the territories of the signatory States’. It seemed to the Committee that the term ‘residing’ might be considered too restrictive. It was felt that there were good grounds for extending the benefits of the Convention to all persons in the territories of the signatory States, even those who could not be considered as residing there in the legal sense of the word. The Committee therefore replaced the term ‘residing’ by the words ‘within their jurisdiction’ which are also contained in Article 2 of the Draft Covenant of the United Nations Commission.” (Vol. III, p. 260)\n"
