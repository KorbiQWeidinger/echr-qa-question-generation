"How does the Court apply Article 4 of the Convention to the facts of trafficking in human beings, considering the nature and aim of exploitation, the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership, and the conditions under which victims live and work, while also taking into account the margin of appreciation of States in implementing measures to combat trafficking?","Trafficking in human beings, by its very nature and aim of exploitation, is based on the exercise of powers attaching to the right of ownership. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold and put to forced labour, often for little or no payment, usually in the sex industry but also elsewhere. It implies close surveillance of the activities of victims, whose movements are often circumscribed. It involves the use of violence and threats against victims, who live and work under poor conditions. There can be no doubt that trafficking threatens the human dignity and fundamental freedoms of its victims and cannot be considered compatible with a democratic society and the values expounded in the Convention (Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, 2010, § 282). Therefore, the Court emphasised that the duty to penalise and prosecute trafficking is only one aspect of member States’ general undertaking to combat trafficking and that the extent of the positive obligations arising under Article 4 must be considered within this broader context (ibid.). Thus, in order to comply with their positive obligations, member States are required to put in place a legislative and administrative framework to prevent and punish trafficking and to protect victims (V.C.L. and A.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2021, § 151). As to the type of operational measure which might be required by Article 4 of the Convention, the Court has considered it relevant in the context of trafficking that the Anti-Trafficking Convention calls on member States to adopt a range of measures to prevent trafficking and to protect the rights of victims. The preventive measures include measures to strengthen coordination at national level between the various anti-trafficking bodies and to discourage the demand for all forms of exploitation of persons.",guide_art_4_eng,"[6, 8, 9, 10, 56, 58, 61]","[

"How does the Court differentiate between applicants and victims in cases involving human trafficking under Article 4 of the Convention, and what criteria does it consider in determining the appropriate level of protection and support for each?","In S.M. v. Croatia [GC], 2020, the Court clarified that conduct or a situation may give rise to an issue of human trafficking under Article 4, only if all the three constituent elements of the international definition of human trafficking, under the Anti-Trafficking Convention and the Palermo Protocol, are present: (1) an action (the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons); (2) the means (threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person); (3) an exploitative purpose (including, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs) (§§ 290 and 303). The vulnerability of victims of trafficking, in particular of minors, must be considered by the State when deciding on the relevant applicable measures (ibid., § 161; see also A.I. v. Italy, 2021, §§ 103-104, where the applicant, victim of trafficking, was unable to exercise her contact rights in respect of her two children in breach of Article 8 of the Convention and N.Ç. v. Turkey, 2021, § 133, where the State failed to protect a sexually exploited minor in the course of the criminal proceedings regarding her sexual abuse under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention). In this respect, the Court has held that early identification of victims of trafficking by a competent authority, on the basis of criteria identified in the Palermo Protocol and the Anti-Trafficking Convention, is of paramount importance and that any decision to prosecute should be taken insofar as possible after this assessment (V.C.L. and A.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2021, §§ 160-161). It also underlined that, once a trafficking assessment had been made by a qualified authority, any subsequent prosecutorial decision would have to take that assessment into account. While the prosecutor might not be bound by the findings made in the course of such an assessment, the prosecutor would need to have clear reasons, consistent with the definition of trafficking contained in the aforementioned international instruments, for disagreeing with it (ibid., § 162).",guide_art_4_eng,"[69, 10, 11, 12, 58, 61, 63]","[

"In the context of Article 4, how does the Court determine whether a particular situation involves all the constituent elements of ""human trafficking"" and/or gives rise to a separate issue of forced prostitution, taking into account the margin of appreciation, positive obligations, and the factual circumstances of the case?","In S.M. v. Croatia [GC], 2020, the Court clarified that conduct or a situation may give rise to an issue of human trafficking under Article 4, only if all the three constituent elements of the international definition of human trafficking, under the Anti-Trafficking Convention and the Palermo Protocol, are present: (1) an action (the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons); (2) the means (threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person); (3) an exploitative purpose (including, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs) (§§ 290 and 303).

"In the case of a minor girl allegedly trafficked for marriage, where the applicant's father received a sum of money, can the payment be considered a price attached to the transfer of ownership, thus constituting slavery under Article 4 of the Convention?","In a case concerning alleged trafficking of a minor girl, the Court also considered that there was not sufficient evidence indicating that she was held in slavery. In this connection, the Court reiterated that marriage has deep-rooted social and cultural connotations which may differ largely from one society to another and that therefore this payment can reasonably be accepted as representing a gift from one family to another, a tradition common to many different cultures in today’s society (M. and Others v. Italy and Bulgaria, 2012, § 161). In considering the scope of “slavery” under Article 4, the Court refers to the classic definition of slavery contained in the 1926 Slavery Convention, which defines slavery as “the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised” (Siliadin v. France, 2005, § 122).",guide_art_4_eng,"[3, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]","[

"In the context of servitude under Article 4 of the Convention, how does the Court differentiate between forced or compulsory labor and servitude based on the victims' feeling that their condition is permanent and unlikely to change, as seen in the case of Siliadin v. France?","The Court noted that servitude was a specific form of forced or compulsory labour, or, in other words, “aggravated” forced or compulsory labour. In fact, the fundamental distinguishing feature between servitude and forced or compulsory labour within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention lies in the victims’ feeling that their condition is permanent and that the situation is unlikely to change. In Siliadin v. France, 2005, the Court considered that the applicant was held in servitude because, in addition to the fact that the applicant was required to perform forced labour, she was a minor with no resources, vulnerable and isolated with no means of living elsewhere than the home where she worked at their mercy and completely depended on them with no freedom of movement and no free time (§§ 126-127). It held that, although the applicant was clearly deprived of her personal autonomy, she was not held in slavery as there was no genuine right of legal ownership over her, thus reducing her to the status of an “object” (§ 122).",guide_art_4_eng,"[3, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20]","[

"In the case of Chowdury and Others v. Greece, the applicants were irregular migrants working in difficult physical conditions and without wages, under the supervision of armed guards, in the strawberry-picking industry in a particular region of Greece. Which Article of the Convention would be applicable to these facts, and what reasons did the Court provide to conclude that this situation constituted human trafficking and forced labor?","In Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, the Court found that Greece had failed to comply with its positive obligations because the authorities, who knew through official reports and the media about the situation in which migrant workers found themselves well before the shooting incident involving the applicants, had failed to take adequate measures to prevent trafficking and to protect the applicants (§§ 111-115). In Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, the Court considered that Greece had failed to comply with its procedural obligations, in particular because the prosecutor had refused to bring proceedings in respect of twenty-one applicants on the grounds that they had lodged their complaints belatedly, without having regard to the wider issues of trafficking and forced labour of which they complained (§§ 117-121). The Court further found that the domestic courts had taken a very narrow view of the applicants’ situation, analysing it from the standpoint of whether it amounted to one of servitude with the consequence that none of the accused was convicted of trafficking in human beings and the appropriate penalties were not therefore applied (§§ 123-127). In a case concerning alleged cross-border human trafficking and forced labour of migrant workers, the Court found the applicants’ claims arguable, given that the materials in the case file, notably, a report prepared by specialised NGOs largely supported the applicants’ version of events (Zoletic and Others v. Azerbaijan, 2021, §§ 161-164). The Court has emphasised that the aforementioned principles are equally relevant when it came to human trafficking and the exploitation of individuals through work. The Court thus accepted that trafficking in human beings covers the recruitment of persons for the purposes of exploitation and that exploitation includes forced labour. It underlined, in this respect, that Article 4 § 2 of the Convention implied a positive obligation for States to address this category of trafficking in the form of a legal and regulatory framework enabling the prevention of trafficking in human beings and their exploitation through work, the protection of victims and the investigation of arguable instances of trafficking of this nature, together with the characterisation as a criminal offence and effective prosecution of any act aimed at maintaining a person in such a situation (Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, §§ 86-89 and 103-104).",guide_art_4_eng,"[34, 35, 36, 66, 74, 76, 58]","[

Greece, 2015, which concerned the obligation imposed on an army officer to pay the State a substantial sum of money to allow him to leave the military before the end of the contracted service period, the Court departed from the above interpretation of the Commission and considered that the limitation under Article 4 § 3 was aimed at military service by conscription only and did not apply to career servicemen. It held that sub- paragraph 3 (b) of Article 4 must be viewed as a whole. A reading of the entire sub-paragraph in its context suggested, for two reasons, that it applied to compulsory military service in States where such a system was in place: firstly, through the reference to conscientious objectors, who will obviously be conscripts and not professional military personnel, and secondly, through the explicit reference to compulsory military service at the end of the sub-paragraph. It further found support for this interpretation in ILO Convention no. 29 as well as in the view taken both by the European Committee of Social Rights and by the Committee of Ministers (§§ 83-89).",guide_art_4_eng,"[34, 38, 44, 45, 46, 47]","[

"How does the positive obligation under Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights require member States to address trafficking in human beings and their exploitation through work, including the prevention of trafficking, protection of victims, and investigation and prosecution of acts aimed at maintaining individuals in such situations?","In its opinion, it was clear from the provisions of these two instruments that the Contracting States, including almost all of the member States of the Council of Europe, have formed the view that only a combination of measures addressing all three aspects can be effective in the fight against trafficking. Therefore, the Court emphasised that the duty to penalise and prosecute trafficking is only one aspect of member States’ general undertaking to combat trafficking and that the extent of the positive obligations arising under Article 4 must be considered within this broader context (ibid.). Thus, in order to comply with their positive obligations, member States are required to put in place a legislative and administrative framework to prevent and punish trafficking and to protect victims (V.C.L. and A.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2021, § 151). In this connection, the Court has held that the spectrum of safeguards set out in national legislation must be adequate to ensure the practical and effective protection of the rights of victims or potential victims of trafficking. It, accordingly, considered that, in addition to criminal law measures to punish traffickers, Article 4 requires member States to put in place adequate measures regulating businesses often used as a cover for human trafficking. Furthermore, a State’s immigration rules must address relevant concerns relating to encouragement, facilitation or tolerance of trafficking (Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, 2010, § 284). Moreover, States are required to provide relevant training for law enforcement and immigration officials (ibid., § 287). The Court thus accepted that trafficking in human beings covers the recruitment of persons for the purposes of exploitation and that exploitation includes forced labour. It underlined, in this respect, that Article 4 § 2 of the Convention implied a positive obligation for States to address this category of trafficking in the form of a legal and regulatory framework enabling the prevention of trafficking in human beings and their exploitation through work, the protection of victims and the investigation of arguable instances of trafficking of this nature, together with the characterisation as a criminal offence and effective prosecution of any act aimed at maintaining a person in such a situation (Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, §§ 86-89 and 103-104). As to the type of operational measure which might be required by Article 4 of the Convention, the Court has considered it relevant in the context of trafficking that the Anti-Trafficking Convention calls on member States to adopt a range of measures to prevent trafficking and to protect the rights of victims. The preventive measures include measures to strengthen coordination at national level between the various anti-trafficking bodies and to discourage the demand for all forms of exploitation of persons. Protection measures include facilitating the identification of victims by qualified persons and assisting victims in their physical, psychological and social recovery (ibid., § 153). The vulnerability of victims of trafficking, in particular of minors, must be considered by the State when deciding on the relevant applicable measures (ibid., § 161; see also A.I. v. Italy, 2021, §§ 103-104, where the applicant, victim of trafficking, was unable to exercise her contact rights in respect of her two children in breach of Article 8 of the Convention and N.Ç. v. Turkey, 2021, § 133, where the State failed to protect a sexually exploited minor in the course of the criminal proceedings regarding her sexual abuse under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention).",guide_art_4_eng,"[69, 56, 57, 58, 61]","[

"In the case of Chowdury and Others v. Greece (2017), how did the Court apply the principles of margin of appreciation and positive obligations in relation to the State's discretion to prevent trafficking and protect migrant workers, considering the knowledge of the authorities about the situation well before the shooting incident involving the applicants?","It underlined, in this respect, that Article 4 § 2 of the Convention implied a positive obligation for States to address this category of trafficking in the form of a legal and regulatory framework enabling the prevention of trafficking in human beings and their exploitation through work, the protection of victims and the investigation of arguable instances of trafficking of this nature, together with the characterisation as a criminal offence and effective prosecution of any act aimed at maintaining a person in such a situation (Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, §§ 86-89 and 103-104). In Chowdury and Others v. Greece, 2017, the Court found that Greece had failed to comply with its positive obligations because the authorities, who knew through official reports and the media about the situation in which migrant workers found themselves well before the shooting incident involving the applicants, had failed to take adequate measures to prevent trafficking and to protect the applicants (§§ 111-115).",guide_art_4_eng,"[64, 65, 66, 74, 76, 77, 58]","[

"In V.C.L. and A.N. v. the United Kingdom, the Court found that the United Kingdom had failed in its duty under Article 4 of the Convention to take operational measures to protect the applicants, who were minors and victims of trafficking. What were the specific circumstances that led the Court to conclude that the United Kingdom violated its obligations under Article 4 in this case?","In V.C.L. and A.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2021, where the Court was called upon to consider whether the prosecution of a victim or potential victim of trafficking raised an issue under Article 4 of the Convention, the Court found that the United Kingdom had failed in its duty under Article 4 to take operational measures to protect the applicants who were minors from Vietnam working in cannabis factories in the United Kingdom. In this respect, it held that, despite the circumstances which indicated that the applicants had been victims of trafficking, they had been charged with a criminal offence without their status as victims of trafficking having been first assessed by the competent authority. The Court further noted that, even though the applicants were subsequently recognized by that authority as victims of trafficking, this assessment was disregarded by both the prosecution service and the Court of Appeal which found the initial decision to prosecute justified without providing adequate reasons for their decision (§§ 172-173 and 181-182).",guide_art_4_eng,"[66, 67, 68, 69, 44, 60]","[

"In the case of an adult victim of trafficking convicted of drug-related offenses, when does the refusal to grant permission to appeal against the conviction comply with the state's operational measures to protect the applicant under Article 26 of the Anti-Trafficking Convention and Article 8 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive, according to the Court's assessment in G.S. v. the United Kingdom?","By contrast, in G.S. v. the United Kingdom, 2021, the Court was satisfied that the Court of Appeal, when refusing the applicant, an adult victim of trafficking, leave to appeal against her conviction on drug related offenses, had considered the extent to which she had been compelled to commit the offence at issue and concluded that the level of compulsion was not such as to extinguish her culpability. It therefore found the manner in which the Court of Appeal assessed the situation to be compatible with Article 26 of the Anti-Trafficking Convention and Article 8 of the Anti-Trafficking Directive and that its refusal to grant permission to appeal could not be construed as a failure of the State under Article 4 to take operational measures to protect the applicant, as a victim of trafficking (§ 24).",guide_art_4_eng,"[67, 68, 69, 70, 59, 61, 63]","[
