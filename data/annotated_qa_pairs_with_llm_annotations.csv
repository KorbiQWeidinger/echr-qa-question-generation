How does the Court apply the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in cases concerning the duration of proceedings?,"In the case of Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], 2017 ( § 215), the Court held that the overall duration – six years and six months across two levels of jurisdiction – of proceedings concerning the compatibility with domestic and European Union law of the mass publication of personal taxation data by the applicant companies did not satisfy the reasonable -time requirement under Article 6 § 1.
The Court found that a period of less than six years over three levels of jurisdiction did not raise an issue with regard to the reasonable -time requirement under Article 6 § 1 (ibid., § 101).
In both contexts regard must be had in particular to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a who le, subject in any event to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State (Bărbulescu v. Romania [GC], 2017, § 112).
In cases which raise the issue of the protection of personal data, the Court has found that the State’s margin of appreciation is broader: where there is no consensus in the member States of the Council of Europe as to the importance of the interest at stake, or the best means of protecting it (Odièvre v. France [GC], 2003, § 47; Breyer v. Germany , 2020, § 108); where the purely financial data at stake w ere not closely related to the applicant’s identity (G.S.B. v. Switzerland , 2015, § 93); and, lastly, in matters of national security (Leander v. Sweden , 1987, § 59).
By contrast, the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities was found to be narrower where, for example, personal data subject to automatic processing which considerably facilitated their access and dissemination could harm a person ’s reputation and render his daily life more difficult (Khelili v. Switzerland, 2011, §§ 64, 70).
The Court also requires domestic law to provide adequate and sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness ( Vinci Construction and GTM Génie Civil and Services v. France , 2015, § 66; Modestou v. Greece , 2017, § 43).
Such guarantees include the existence of “effective scrutiny” of measures encroaching on Article 8 ( ibid. , § 42).
In respect of retention regimes for the biometric data of convicted persons, the duration of the retention period is not necessarily conclusive in assessing whether a State has overstepped the acceptable margin of appreciation in establishing the relevant regime –- the existence and functioning of certain safeguards is decisive ( Gaughran v. the United Kingdom , 2020, § 88).
The existence or lack of independent review of the justification for retention of the information according to defined criteria such as the seriousness of the offence, the strength of the suspicion against the person, previous convictions and any other special circumstances , is a major safeguard for ensuring the proportionality of data retention periods ( ibid. , § 94; S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 119; B.B. v. France , 2009, § 68; Gardel v. France , 2009, § 69; M.B. v. France , 2009, § 60).
More generally, the Court stressed that modern investigation methods might indeed produce enormous amounts of data, the integration of which into the criminal proceedings should not cause unnecessary delays to those p roceedings.
The mere fact that the court proceedings had already begun when the lawyer obtained a full copy of the file did not mean that he had not had sufficient time to prepare.",5,5,4,4,3,Overreliance: the answer heavily focuses on a few cases or a specific context and does not address the broader picture,guide_data_protection,"[369, 370, 371, 76, 77, 167, 212, 376]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a detailed explanation of how the Court applies the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in cases concerning the duration of proceedings.

"How does the margin of appreciation apply in the context of a State's discretion to regulate access to its territory for non-nationals, particularly in cases involving visa applications and asylum seekers?","As mentioned above, access to the territory for non-nationals is not expressly regulated in the Convention, nor does it say who should receive a visa.
The Court has also examined cases in which border guards prevented persons from entering the respondent State ’s territory by not allowing them to disembark at a port ( Kebe and Others v. Ukraine , 2017) or at a land border checkpoint ( M.A. and Others v. Lithuania , 2018; M.K. and Others v. Poland , 2020) and either prevented the applicants from lodging an asylum application or, where they had submitted such applications, refused to accept them and to initiate asylum proceedings.
Firstly, it has to be taken into account whether the State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures , to allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms including the Convention.
Secondly, w here the State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, it has to be considered whether there were cogent reasons for not do ing so which were based on objective facts for which the State was responsible.
The absence of such cogent reasons could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applican ts’ own conduct, justifying the lack of individual identification.
The burden of proof for showing that the applicants did have genuine and effective access to procedures for legal entry is on the respondent State and all cases decided thus far turned on whether the State had satisfied that burden of proof ( location of the border crossing points, modalities for lodging applications there, availability of interpreters/legal assistance enabling asylum -seekers to be informed of their rights and information sho wing that applications had actually been made at those border points: compare N.D. and N.T. v.

"How does the margin of appreciation apply to a State's discretion in determining whether the deprivation of liberty is considered ""unlawful"" within the meaning of domestic law, and what factors do the Court take into consideration in assessing the proportionality and necessity of the restriction?","Article 5 § 5 creates a direct and enforceable right to compensation before the national courts (A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2009, § 229; Storck v. Germany , 2005, § 122).
If a given instance of deprivation of liberty does not fit within the confines of one of the sub - paragraphs of Article 5 , as interpreted by the Court, it cannot be made to fit by an appeal to the need to balance the interests of the State against those of the detainee (Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 298).
Where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied.
It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Conve ntion, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail ( Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, § 92; Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], 2013, § 125; Creangă v. Romania , 2012, § 120; Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], 2010, § 80).
Article 5 § 1 thus does not merely refer back to domestic law, it also relates to the “quality of the law” which implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application.
Factors relevant to this assessment of the “quality of law” – which are referred to in some cases as “safeguards against arbitrariness” – will include the existence of clear legal provisions for ordering detention, for extending detention, and for setting time -limits for detention; and the existence of an effective remedy by which the applicant can contest the “lawfulness” and “length” of his continuing detention (J.N. v. the United Kingdom , 2016, § 77).
Factors to be taken into consideration include the purpose of the order, the feasibility of compliance with the order, and the duration of the detention.
The matters which the judicial officer must examine go beyond the question of lawfulness.
The review required under Article 5 § 3, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual ’s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention ( Aquilina v. Malta [GC], 1999, § 52).",4,4,5,4,5,,guide_art_5,"[296, 297, 298, 28, 33, 34, 69, 196]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation and the factors considered by the Court in assessing the proportionality and necessity of the restriction. It explains the requirement for clear and foreseeable domestic law, the relevance of safeguards against arbitrariness, and the factors to be taken into consideration in assessing the lawfulness of deprivation of liberty.

How does the margin of appreciation apply in relation to a State's discretion to investigate allegations of ill-treatment administered by private individuals?,"This procedural obligation also extends to a requirement to investigate allegations of ill - treatment administered by private individuals when they are “arguable” ( M. and Others v. Italy and Bulgaria , 2012 , § 100 and X and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2021 , § 184; see also Ghişoiu v. Romania , (dec.), 2023, § § 62-64where no procedural obligations were triggered in the absence of an arguable claim in the context of alleged violence towards a minor ).
The purpose of the investigation
The essential purpose of an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws prohibiting torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in cases involving States agents or b odies, and to ensure their accountability for ill -treatment occurring under their responsibility ( Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], 2015 , § 117).
The nature and degree of scrutiny
The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation ’s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case.
Where an individual raises an arguable claim that she or he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of State agents , that provision, read in conjunction with the State ’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation ( Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria , 1998, § 102 and El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Maced onia [GC], 2012 , § 182).
Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the S tate to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity ( Labita v. Italy [GC], 2000 , § 131).
It follows that, while granting substantial deference to the national authorities and courts in the choice of appropriate sanctions for ill -treatment, the Court must exercise a certain power of review and intervene in cases of manifest disproportion between the gravity of the act and the punishment imposed (Myumyun v. Bulgaria , 2015 , § 67).
Firstly, the State authorities must have conducted a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.
Secondly, an award o f compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage which the applicant sustained as a result of the ill -treatment ( Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], 2010, § 116; Razzakov v. Russia , 2015, § 50).",5,5,4,4,4,,guide_art_3,"[120, 121, 122, 118, 145, 150]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation in relation to a State's discretion to investigate allegations of ill-treatment administered by private individuals.

How does the principle of margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply to the State's discretion in implementing immigration policies?,"Although Article 8 does not include a right to settle in a particular country o r a right to obtain a residence permit, the State must nevertheless exercise its immigration policies in a manner which is compatible with a foreign national ’s human rights, in particular the right to respect for his or her private or family life and the right not to be subject to discrimination ( Novruk and Others v. Russia , 2016 , § 83).
The Court has held that a restrictive interpretation of the concept of “family member” (which excludes homosexual partners who cannot get married or enter into a civil partnership under the law of the receiving State) results in homosexual couples facing an insurmountable obstacle to obtaining a residence permit for family reasons ( Taddeucci and McCall v. Italy , 2016 , § 83).
Thus, a failure to apply different treatment to such homosexual couples may be in breach of Article 14 of the Convention (ibid. , § 98).
Thus, the State had infringed the applicants ’ right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sexual orientation in the enjoyment of their rights under Article 8 of the Convention.
In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual : in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation ( B. v. France , 1992, § 44; Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014 , § 67; O.H. and G.H. v. Germany , 2023, §§ 109 -111).
Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider ( X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom , 1997 , § 44; Fretté v. France , 2002 , § 41; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002 , § 85).
See also, albeit in the context of Article 9, but of interest to the subject matter of this Guide, Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom , 2013 , § 102-110).
As noted previously, States have a positive obligation to secure the effective enjoyment of Convention rights and freedoms.
This obligation is of particular importance for persons holding unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they are more vulnerable to victimisation (Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania , 2020 , § 108).",4,5,5,4,3,Lack of Specificity: the question is formulated too broad/ambiguous which makes the answer imprecise,guide_lgbti_rights,"[147, 148, 149, 46, 48, 50, 126, 151]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the principle of margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply to the State's discretion in implementing immigration policies.

"How does the margin of appreciation apply when domestic courts are unable to attach any tangible legal consequences to the discriminatory motives of a crime, causing a violation of the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14 taken together with Article 2?","The duty to respond appropriately to such attacks extends to the judicial proceedings in which it is decided whether and how to convict and punish alleged perpetrators ( Stoyanova v. Bulgaria, 2018, § 64).
For example, where the applicant ’s son was murdered by three men who perceived him as being homosexual, the Court found a violation of Article 14 taken together with Article 2 because the domestic courts could not attach any tangible legal consequence s to the homophobic motives of the crime when sentencing the perpetrators.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres ( Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, §§ 134-135; Vilnes and Others v. Norway , 2013, § 220; Brincat and Others v. Malta, 2014, § 101).
When investigating violent attacks, the authorities must take all reasonable steps to unmask any possible discriminatory motives for them.
Failure to make a distinction in the manner in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 2 ( Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 160).
The Court has further emphasised in this connection that the choice of means for ensuring the respect for positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
However, for this obligation to be satisfied, such proceedings must not only exist in theory but also operate effectively in practice ( Cevrioğlu v. Turkey , 2016, §§ 53 and 55; Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC] , 2017, § 216).",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_art_2,"[197, 198, 199, 41, 194, 212]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the question by explaining the duty of domestic courts to respond appropriately to attacks and the violation of Article 14 taken together with Article 2 in cases where discriminatory motives are not considered in sentencing.

How does the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in relation to the State's discretion to attach legal consequences to discriminatory motives in criminal cases?,"As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres ( Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, §§ 134-135; Vilnes and Others v. Norway , 2013, § 220; Brincat and Others v. Malta, 2014, § 101).
Moreover, it recalled that the choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means (Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 65; Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 102).
When investigating violent attacks, the authorities must take all reasonable steps to unmask any possible discriminatory motives for them.
Treating violence with a discriminatory intent on an equal footing with violence having no such overtones is tantamount to turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights ( Stoyanova v. Bulgaria, 2018 , § 64).
Failure to make a distinction in the manner in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 2 ( Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 160).
There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
However, for this obligation to be satisfied, such proceedings must not only exist in theory but also operate effectively in practice ( Cevrioğlu v. Turkey , 2016, §§ 53 and 55; Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC] , 2017, § 216).",4,5,5,4,5,,guide_art_2,"[197, 198, 199, 41, 42, 65, 194, 212]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in relation to the State's discretion to attach legal consequences to discriminatory motives in criminal cases. It discusses the State's margin of appreciation in choosing practical measures to fulfill positive obligations, the consideration of operational choices and resources, the need to unmask discriminatory motives in violent attacks, the importance of distinguishing between different situations, and the requirement for effective proceedings.

"How does the margin of appreciation apply when determining whether treatment amounts to ""torture"" under the Convention, considering the specific factual circumstances and the interests of the State?","In order to determine whether the threshold of severity has been reached, other factors may be taken into consideration, in particular: (a) the purpose for which the ill -treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Conv ention; (b) the context in which the ill -treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions ; and (c) whether the victim is in a vulnerable situation ( Khlaifia and Others v.

How does the Court assess the imputability of impugned acts to the State in cases where the behavior of a State agent is unlawful?,"The Court has held that where the behaviour of a State agent is unlawful, the question of whether the impugned acts can be imputed to the State requires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances and consideration of the nature and circumstances of the conduct in question.

"How does the concept of ""reasonable suspicion"" apply to the requirement of a ""competent legal authority"" under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention, and what are the consequences of a failure by the authorities to conduct a genuine inquiry into the basic facts of a case?","The “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c) (Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 314; Mehmet Hasan Altan v. Turkey , 2018, § 124; Fernandes Pedroso v. Portugal , 2018, § 87).
The fact that a suspicion is held in good faith is insufficient in itself ( Sabuncu and Others v. Turkey , 2020, § 145).
A “reasonable suspicion” that a criminal offence has been committed presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed an offence (Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 314; Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan , 2014, § 88; Erdagöz v. Turkey , 1997, § 51; and Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom , 1990, § 32).
Therefore, a failure by the authorities to make a genuine inquiry into the basic facts of a case in order to verify whether a complaint was well-founded disclosed a violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) (Stepuleac v. Moldova , 2007, § 73; Elçi and Others v. Turkey , 2003, § 674; Moldoveanu v. the Republic of Moldova , 2021, §§ 52-57, where the applicant had been arrested and detained on fraud charges following her failure to repay her debt to a third party ).
In addition to its factual side, the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c) requires that the facts relied on can be reasonably considered to fall under one of the sections of the law dealing with criminal behaviour.
If a person is detained under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Con vention, the “court” must be empowered to examine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that he or she has committed an offence, because the existence of such a suspicion is essential if detention on remand is t o be “lawful” under the Convention ( Dimo Dimov and Others v. Bulgaria , 2020, § 70; Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], 1999, § 58).",3,5,5,4,5,,guide_art_5,"[88, 89, 90, 83, 94, 201, 256]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of ""reasonable suspicion"" applies to the requirement of a ""competent legal authority"" under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.

What factors does the Court consider when determining whether a restriction on rights is justified under the margin of appreciation doctrine?,"The Court may also proceed on the assumption that the restriction of the applicant ’s right or freedom pursued a legitimate purpose and examine a case from the standpoint of a potential plurality of purposes.
In assessing this point, the Court will analyse the extent to which the authorities were determined to pursue the alleged ulterior purpose ( Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 329).
It will give weight to the following considerations: in the first place, whether the authorities attached the utmost importance to their actions targeting a specific individual or a group; and whether a given case belongs to an established pattern of misuse of power by the respondent State ( Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § § 76-77).
Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights Nature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose
In this respect, the Court will assess the impact of the impugned restriction and the extent of gravity of the ulterior purpose, as defined by the core of the applicant ’s Article 18 complaint.
In particular, the Court may examine whether the impugned restriction would affect merely the applicant or his fellow activists /supporters or the very essence of democracy as a means of organising society in which individual freedom may only be limited in the general interest ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § § 173-174; Natig Jafarov v. Azerbaijan , 2019, § 69; Kavala v. Turkey , 2019, § 231; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 436; and Kogan and Others v.

How does the margin of appreciation apply to the State's discretion in investigating and holding those responsible for the poor maintenance of a river channel in a flood case?,"Having regard to the broad margin of appreciation granted to S tates in environmental cases , it is primarily incumbent on the national authorities to ass ess the “necessity ” of an interference (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001; Giacomelli v. Italy , 2006 , § 80; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom , 2012, § 218), as regards both the legal framework and the specific implementing measures (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001).
In view of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities in that domain, it is not in the Court ’s remit to determine what exactly should have been done to put an end to or reduce the disturbance.
The Court can, however, assess whether the authorities approached the matter with due diligence and took all the competing interests into consideration (Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, 2010 , § 98; Podelean v. Romania (dec.), 2019 ; Kotov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 134).
In taking, for general -interest purposes, action amounting to an interference in the right to property , States enjoy a broad margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement in achieving the aim in question and to appraising the proportionality of those means to th e aim.
The Court has emphasised that that is particularly the case where the general interest pursued concerns environmental protection ( Hamer v. Belgium , 2007 , § 78; Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Matczyńsk i v. Poland, 2015, § § 105-106; S.C. Fiercolect Impex S.R.L. v. Romania , 2016, § 67; Tumeliai v. Lithuania, 2018, § 72).
Similarly the Court has pointed out that the marge of appreciation is broader where the alleged interference in the right to respect for property relates to spatial planning and environmental protection policies (Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Malfatto and Mieille v. France , 2016, § 64; Barcza and Others v. Hungary , 2016 , § 46; O’Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v. Irlande , 2018 , § 124) ; (Bērziņš and Others v. Latvia, 2021, § 90).
Apart from the broader margin of appreciation mentioned above , the case -law principles relating to the right to respect for property apply in a fairly standard manner to measures restricting that right which are aimed at environmental conservation (see Guide on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).",5,5,5,4,3,,guide_environment,"[29, 30, 31, 108, 122, 173, 175]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the margin of appreciation in the context of investigating and holding those responsible for poor maintenance of a river channel in a flood case.

How does the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in relation to the State's discretion to initiate criminal prosecutions against politicians and high-ranking officials after a change of power?,"Although criminal prosecutions initiated against politicians and high -ranking officials after a change of power could suggest a wish to eliminate or harm them or their political parties, they could equally reflect a desire to deal with alleged wrongdoings under a previous government whose members could not beheld to account while in power ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 323; Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia , 2013, § 903).
The mere fact that a politician is criminally prosecuted, even during an electoral campaign or a referendum , is not automatically in breach of his/her right to run for office ; nor does it automatically indicate that the aim pursued is to restrict political debate (and Selahattin Demirtaş v.

"How does the notion of margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in the context of taking blood samples of sex workers on suspicion of spreading sexually transmitted diseases, as seen in the case of D.H. and Others v. North Macedonia?","All in all, the decision -making process had been fair and had properly protected the applicant ’s interests as secured under Article 8.
In particular, in the case of D.H. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2023 (§§ 52-53) the Court was of the opinion that taking of blood samples of the applicants, all sex workers, on suspicion of an offence of spreading sexually transmitted diseases had not been in violation of the requirements of Article 8 since that medical act had been ordered by a judge; it had been performed by a medical doctor at a clinic; and it had never been alleged by the applicant that it had involved an excessive use of force or had been detrimental to their health.
Broadly speaking, the use of various compulsory medical acts for the purposes of cellular sampling, such as blood tests and buccal swabs, is not prohibited as such in the context of taking evidence in civil or criminal proceedings ( Jalloh v. Germany [GC], 2006, § 70; Caruana v. Malta (dec.), 2018, § 41; D.H. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2023, § 52).

"How does the Court determine whether a matter falls to be examined under Article 10 or 11 in the context of freedom of assembly, and how does this determination affect the assessment of the State's obligations and the justification for restrictions?","These are only relevant after the Court concludes that a demonstration falls into the scope of protection, for the ensuing question of t he State ’s negative obligations (whether a restriction on the protected freedom is justified under Article 11 § 2) as well as for an assessment of the State ’s positive obligations (whether the latter has struck a fair balance between the competing interest s at stake) ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018 , § 99).
Lastly, it should be noted that the case -law of the Court laid down a distinction on whether a certain matter falls t o be examined under Article 10 or 11.2 One of the distinctive criteria noted by the Court is that in the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly the participants would not only be seeking to express their opinion, but to do so together with others ( Primov and Others v. Russia , 2014 , § 91).
Similarly, in Bumbeș v. Romania , §§ 69-70, the Court considered that a spontaneous short protest action staged by an environmental activist, in which in total of four persons participated, predominantly concerned expression , which was more appropriately examined under Article 10 interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention .
On the other hand, when the thrust of the applicant ’s complaint concerns a conviction for holding peaceful assemblies, the Court examines the complaint under Article 11 alone ( Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania , 2015 , § 85).
Although the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom , 2007, § 37; Nemtsov v.

How does the Court assess the legitimacy of workplace surveillance measures under Article 8 of the ECHR?,"In the cases of Halford v. the United Kingdom , 1997 (§ § 50-51) and Copland v. the United Kingdom , 2007 (§ 48), the Court found that in the absence, at the material time, of a domestic legal provision authorising the collection of personal data from non -professional telephone calls by employees and from electronic messages sent from the workplace, respectively, the resultant interference with their right to respect for private life had not been “in accordance with the law”.
The existence of reasonable suspicion that serious misconduct has been committed and the extent of the losses identified in the present case may constitute weighty justification for employers to implement personal data -collection in the workplace ( López Ribalda and Others v. Spain [GC] , 2019, § 134).
Conversely, mere suspicions of misappropriation or any other wrongdoing on the part of employees cannot justify the installation of covert video -surveillance by the employer ( ibid. , § 134).
In that context, the national authorities have to answer the following questions: was the employee notified of the possibility that the employer might take measures to monitor correspondence and other communications, and of the implementation of such measures ?
What was the extent of the monitoring by the employer and the degree of intrusion into the employee ’s privacy ?
Did the employer provide legitimate reasons to justify monitoring the employee’s communications ?
Would it have been possible to establish a monitoring system based on less intrusive methods and measures than directly accessing the content of the employee’s communications ?
What were the consequences of the monitoring for the employee subjected to it?
Had the employee been provided with adequate safeguards, especially when the employer ’s monitoring operations were of an intrusive nature ?
And finally, the domestic authorities should ensure that an employee whose communications have been monitored has access to a remedy before a judicial body with jurisdiction to determine, at least in substance, how the criteria outlined above were observed and whether the impugned measures were lawful ( ibid. , § 122).",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_data_protection,"[154, 155, 156, 82, 129, 153, 158]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that the Court considers when assessing the legitimacy of workplace surveillance measures under Article 8 of the ECHR.

"How does the European Court of Human Rights determine whether it is justified to continue examining an application for removal, considering the margin of appreciation, the necessity for continued examination, and the respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto?","In removal cases, in which the applicant no longer face s any risk, at the moment or for a considerable time to come, of being expelled and in which he ha s the opportunity to challenge any new expulsion order before the national authorities and if necessary before the Court, the Court normally finds that it is no longer justified to continue to examine the application within the meaning of Article 37 § 1(c) of the Convention and strikes it out of its list of cases, unless there are special circumstances relating to respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto requiring the continued examination of the application (see Khan v. Germany [GC] , 2016 ).
By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities.

"In cases where a State restricts the use of private property to protect the environment, how does the Court determine whether the fair balance has been upset in terms of regulating the use of property?","The Court will verify in particular whether , having regard to the State ’s margin of appreciation , the applicant had to bear an individual and excessive burden such that the fair balance which should have been struck between th e protection of the right to property and the requirements of the general interest had been upset ( Hamer v. Belgium , 2007, § 78; Turgut and Others v. Turkey , 2008 , § 91; Köktepe v. Turkey , 2008, § § 91-92; Consort s Richet and Le Ber v. France , 2010 , §§ 115 and 124; Gavrilova and Others v. Russia , 2021, § § 74 and 87; Sakskoburggotski and Chrobok v. Bulgaria, 2021, §§ 261 -268; Bērziņš and Others v. Latvia, 2021, § 90).
Thus, for example, a deprivation of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances ; that applies whether the expropriation was aimed at protecting the environment or had a different purpose (Turgut and Others v. Turkey , 2008, § § 91-92; Cin and Others v. Turkey , 2009, § 30; Temel Conta Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.Ş. v. Turkey , 2009, § 43; Kök and Others v. Turkey , 2009 , § 23; Yıldırır v.

Turkey , 2013, § 48; Valle Pierimpiè Società Agricola S.P.A. v. Italy , 2014 , § 71).
The judgment in the case of Z.A.N.T.E. – Marathonisi A.E. v. Greece , 2007 , § 54, is worth mentioning because it shows that where a State adopts measures to restrict the right to property with a view to protecting the environment , the fair balance can be upset if the authorities fail to take other action to ensure such protection (see also the Court ’s considerations in the case of G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], § § 295-299, 2018) .
Noting that the authorities had tolerated activities on the land in question which were incompatible with the reasons for which the applicant company ’s property had been subjected to very severe operational restrictions ( the small island had been invaded by tourists on a daily basis, its beach had been severe ly polluted and there had been no toilets ), the Court found that the requisite fair balance had been upset between the public interest and private interests in terms of regulating the use of property .
It emphasised the following : “... where the State impose s major restrictions on the exploitation of a private property with a view to guaranteeing effective environmental protection , it must, as a minimum, not tolerate activities liable to undermine the efforts to achieve that aim .
Otherwise, the aim of the restriction may lapse and the burden initially imposed on the party concerned will become more intolerable to that party; this is a factor which must be taken into account in assessing the restriction ’s proportionality to the aim pursu ed.
In the present case it would be unreasonable for the S tate to require the applicant to comply with severe restrictions on the enjoyment of his property with a view to protecting the loggerhead turtle while the competent authorities fail to take the requisite action vis -à-vis activities endanger ing the achievement of the said aim ”.",5,5,4,4,3,Overreliance: the answer heavily focuses on a few cases or a specific context and does not address the broader picture,guide_environment,"[176, 177, 178, 167, 173, 175, 180]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the Court determines whether the fair balance has been upset in cases where a State restricts the use of private property to protect the environment.

What are the criteria used by the Court to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in cases where the value of property has been affected?,"Noting that the wall had deprived the applicant ’s house of its sea view and marred the traditional character of the village, thus decreasing the value of the applic ant’s property , the Court deduced that the authorities had been responsible for the interference in her property rights , which interference was covered by the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
It found a violation of the provision on the grounds that the refusal or omission on the part of the authorities had had no legal basis in domestic law.
However, the Court has so far never found a violation of that provision in such a context, since no applic ants have ever provided evidence of a consequent decrease in value of their properties ( Flamenbaum and Others v. France , 2012 , § 190; Płachta and Others v. Poland (dec.), 2014).
The Court found no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on the grounds that the applicant had produced no evidence to show that there had been an impact on his property or that the latter had decreased in value .
The Court declared the complaint manifest ly ill- founded on the grounds that the applic ants had produced evidence neither of the decrease in value of their properties nor of any economic impact on their occupational activities .
For an interference with the right to property to be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, it must comply with the rule of law and pursue a legitimate aim in the general or public interest .
In that regard , the Court will verify whether a fair balance has been struck between the requirements of the public interest and the interests of the person concerned .
In doing so it will grant the S tate a broad margin of appreciation both in choosing the methods and means of implementation and in assessing whether their consequences have been legitimated, in the public interest , by the concern to achieve the aim pursued ( see Guide on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).",5,5,4,4,5,Overreliance: the answer heavily focuses on a few cases or a specific context and does not address the broader picture,guide_environment,"[184, 185, 186, 168, 179, 180, 190]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the criteria used by the Court to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in cases where the value of property has been affected.

How does the margin of appreciation apply in cases where individuals claim a right to the environment under domestic law?,"The Court has pointed out that although environmental protection should be taken into consideration by States in acting within their margin of appreciation and by the Court in its review of that margin, it would not b e appropriate for the Court to adopt a special approach in this respect by reference to a special status of environmental human rights protection ( Hatton and Others v. United Kingdom [GC], 2003, § 122; Ashworth and Others v. United Kingdom (dec.), 2004).
Having regard to the broad margin of appreciation granted to S tates in environmental cases , it is primarily incumbent on the national authorities to ass ess the “necessity ” of an interference (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001; Giacomelli v. Italy , 2006 , § 80; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom , 2012, § 218), as regards both the legal framework and the specific implementing measures (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001).
The Court has emphasised that that is particularly the case where the general interest pursued concerns environmental protection ( Hamer v. Belgium , 2007 , § 78; Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Matczyńsk i v. Poland, 2015, § § 105-106; S.C. Fiercolect Impex S.R.L. v. Romania , 2016, § 67; Tumeliai v. Lithuania, 2018, § 72).
Similarly the Court has pointed out that the marge of appreciation is broader where the alleged interference in the right to respect for property relates to spatial planning and environmental protection policies (Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Malfatto and Mieille v. France , 2016, § 64; Barcza and Others v. Hungary , 2016 , § 46; O’Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v.

"In the case of migrants intercepted at sea and summarily returned to Libya, the Court found violations of various provisions of the Convention. Discuss how the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in this case, taking into account the State's control over the migrants and the knowledge of the risks they would face in Libya.?","The Court found that the applicants fell within the respondent State ’s jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention as it exercised control over them on the high seas and considered that the Italian authorities knew, or should have known, that the applicants, when returned to Libya as irregular migrants, would be exposed to treatment in breach of the Convention, that they would not be given any kind of protection and that there were insufficient guarantees protecting them from the risk of being arbitrarily returned to their countries of origin.
It reaffirmed that the fact that the applicants had not asked for asylum or described the risks they faced as a result of the lack of asylum system in Libya did not exempt the respondent State from complying with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention.
It also found violations of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 of the Convention and of Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3 and Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.
Secondly, while noting that it could not pronounce itself, in the absence of an effective investigation, on several details of the rescue operation nor on the question of whether there had been an attempt to push the applicants back towards Turkish waters as alleged, the Court concluded, having regard to certain facts which were undisputed or otherwise established, that the Greek authorities had failed to comply with the duty under Article 2 to take preventive operational measures to protect the individuals whose lives were at risk.
Having regard to a number of omissions and delays in the manner in which the rescue operation was conducted and organised, the Court found that the authorities had not done all that could reasonably be expected of them to provide all the applicants and their relatives with the level of protection required.
Once they had received information about one of the migrants being in distress, they did not take all operational measures which could reasonably be expected of them to protect the life of the applicant ’s brother, thus not satisfying their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (§§ 131-144) .",5,5,5,4,5,Overreliance: the answer heavily focuses on a few cases or a specific context and does not address the broader picture,guide_immigration,"[14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 26, 30]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the case, discussing the jurisdiction of the respondent State, the knowledge of the risks faced by the migrants in Libya, and the violations of various provisions of the Convention.

Margin of appreciation: How does the margin of appreciation apply in the context of determining the compliance of extradition with Article 3 regarding the risk of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole?","Where an individual may face life imprisonment in the State requesting his extradition, a two - stage test is to be applied to determine the compliance of the extradition with Article 3 (Sanchez - Sanchez v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2022, §§ 95-99):
At the first stage, it must be established whether the applicant has adduced evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited and convicted, there is a real risk of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.
If the said risk is established under the first limb of the inquiry, then the relevant authorities of the sending State must establish, prior to authorising extradition, that there exists in the requesting State a mechanism of sentence review which all ows those competent authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant and that such progress towards rehabilitation has been made during the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds.

In Navalnyy, v. Russia [GC], 2018 , an opposition political leader was arrested seven times over two years.

How does the Court determine whether a matter falls under Article 10 or Article 11 of the Convention and what criteria does it consider in making this distinction?,"Lastly, it should be noted that the case -law of the Court laid down a distinction on whether a certain matter falls t o be examined under Article 10 or 11.2 One of the distinctive criteria noted by the Court is that in the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly the participants would not only be seeking to express their opinion, but to do so together with others ( Primov and Others v. Russia , 2014 , § 91).
Moreover, in Éva Molnár v. Hungary , 2008, § 42, the Court emphasised that one of the aims of freed om of assembly is to secure a forum for public debate and the open expression of protest.
The protection of the expression of personal opinions, secured by Article 1 0, is one of the objectives of the freedom of peaceful assembly enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention .
Thus, the Court examined under Article 10 the prosecution of those calling for support for unauthorised protests by way of issuing an internet post ( Elvira Dmitriyeva v. Russia , 2019 , § 77-90).
In Butkevich v. Russia , 2018 , § 122, the Court found it appropriate to examine the application of a journalist prosecuted and convicted for not co -operating with the police while covering a G4 summit under Article 10, taking into account the general principles it had established in the context of Article 11 of the Convention .
Similarly, in Bumbeș v. Romania , §§ 69-70, the Court considered that a spontaneous short protest action staged by an environmental activist, in which in total of four persons participated, predominantly concerned expression , which was more appropriately examined under Article 10 interpreted in the light of Article 11 of the Convention .
On the other hand, when the thrust of the applicant ’s complaint concerns a conviction for holding peaceful assemblies, the Court examines the complaint under Article 11 alone ( Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania , 2015 , § 85).
In this context, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, which is a lex specialis taking precedence for assemblies ( Ezelin v. France , 1991, § 35; Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany , 2011 , § 101; Hakim Aydın v. Turkey , 2020, § 41).

How does the Court determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorized manner and are expelled summarily?,"In N.D. an d N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, §§ 201 and 209 -211, the Court set out a two -tier test to determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorised manner and are expelled summarily, a test which has been applied in all later cases presenting precisely the same scenario ( Shahzad v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 59 et seq .; and M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, §§ 294 et seq .; A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia , 2022, §§ 112-123):
Firstly, it has to be taken into account whether the State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures , to allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms including the Convention.
Secondly, w here the State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, it has to be considered whether there were cogent reasons for not do ing so which were based on objective facts for which the State was responsible.
The absence of such cogent reasons could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applican ts’ own conduct, justifying the lack of individual identification.
The burden of proof for showing that the applicants did have genuine and effective access to procedures for legal entry is on the respondent State and all cases decided thus far turned on whether the State had satisfied that burden of proof ( location of the border crossing points, modalities for lodging applications there, availability of interpreters/legal assistance enabling asylum -seekers to be informed of their rights and information sho wing that applications had actually been made at those border points: compare N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC] , 2020, §§ 212-217; A.A. and Ot hers v. North Macedonia , 2022, §§ 116-122, and contrast Shahzad v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 63-67; M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, §§ 295-304).
Where migrants entered the respondent State ’s territory in an unauthorised manner and, following their apprehension near the border, were provided with access to means of legal entry through the appropriate border procedure, the Court did not apply the aforementioned two -tier test, but instead assessed – in order to determine whether the expulsion was “coll ective” in nature – whether the individuals were afforded, prior to the adoption of expulsion orders, an effective possibility of submitting arguments against their removal and whether there were sufficient guarantees demonstrating that their personal circ umstances had been genuinely and individually taken into account ( Asady and Others v. Slovakia , 2020, § 62).
Such test is, essentially, similar to the one applied to individuals who present themselves a t a point of legal entry, such as a border checkpoint (see M.K. and Others v. Poland , 2020, §§ 204-211, D.A. and Others v. Poland , 2021, §§ 81- 84, and M.A. and Others v. Latvia (dec.), 2022, §§ 67-69).
Whether the requirements of this test are satisfied is a question of fact, which is to be determined by having regard to, in so far as pertinent in a given case, supporting evidence provided by the parties, including as to whether an identification process was conducted and under what conditions (whether persons were trained to conduct interviews, whether information was provided, in a language the individuals understood, about the possibility to lodge an asylum application and to request legal aid, whether interpreters were present, and whether the individuals were able, in practice, to consult lawyers and to lodge asylum applicati ons) as well as to independent reports ( Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], 2012, § 185; Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece , 2014, §§ 214-225; Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, §§ 245- 254; Asady and Others v.

How did the Court apply the margin of appreciation doctrine and assess the necessity and proportionality of the absolute prohibition on second-parent adoption for same-sex couples in the cases of X and Others v. Austria and S.W. and Others v. Austria?,"This is so in immigration cases also where States are otherwise allowed a wide margin of appreciation ( Pajić v. Croatia , 2016 , § 82).
The existence of de facto family life between the applicants ; the importance of having the possibility of obtaining legal recognition thereof ; the lack of evidence adduced by the Government to show that it would be detrimental to the child to be brought up by a same -sex couple or to have two mothers and two fathers for legal purposes ; and especially their admission that same -sex couples may be as suited for second - parent adoption as different -sex couples , cast considerable doubt on the proportionality of the absolute prohibition on second -parent adoption in same -sex couples.
In conclusion, the Court found that the Government had failed to adduce particularly weighty and convincing reasons to show that excluding second -parent adoption in a same -sex couple, while allowing that possibility in an unmarried different -sex couple, was necessary for the protection of the family in the traditional sense or for the protection of the interests of the child.
The distinction was thus in breach of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention (ibid. , § 153).
However, the Court found that the way the birth certificate was set out did not constitute an interference with their right to respect for private and family life.
It considered that birth certificates normally reflect the current legal relationship at the time of issuance, and not biological parentage , and in cases of same -sex parents, it was always known that at least one of them was not genetically related to the child and, if mentioned on the child ’s birth certificate as a parent, must have adopted the child.
This Section will however tackle certain principles which are particularly relevant in the context of LGBTI.
In cases in which the margin of appreciation afforded to States is narrow (as is the position where there is a difference in treatment based on sex or sexual orientation) , the principle of proportionality does not merely require the measure chosen to be suitable in principle for achievement of the aim sought.
It must also be shown that it was necessary, in order to achieve that aim, to exclude certain categories of people from the scope of the provisions in issue ( Karner v. Austria , 2003 , § 41; Kozak v. Poland , 2010 , § 99; Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], 2013 , § 85).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[137, 138, 139, 89, 119, 126]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court applied the margin of appreciation doctrine and assessed the necessity and proportionality of the absolute prohibition on second-parent adoption for same-sex couples in the cases of X and Others v. Austria and S.W. and Others v. Austria. It discusses the existence of de facto family life, the importance of legal recognition, the lack of evidence on the detriment to the child, and the admission that same-sex couples may be as suited for second-parent adoption.

How did the Court balance the wide margin of appreciation of the respondent State and the best interests of the child in the case of O.H. and G.H. v. Germany?,"The Court considered that the respondent State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation, given the lack of a European consensus on the matter, as well as the fact that the authorities had been called upon to weigh up a number of private and public interests against several competing rights .
Special attention was given to the public interest in the coherence of the legal system and the accuracy and completeness of civil registration records , which records were of a particular evidential value (§§ 114-116).
The Court considered that the best interests of the child had to be examined exhaustively in this context , taking into account any conflict of interest between the child and his transgender paren ts.
It was also necessary to take account of the child ’s possible future interests and the interests of children who are in a comparable situation and to whom the legislative provisions in question also appl ied.
The Court stressed that the child ’s well-being could not be examined individually because of his young age at the time it was necessary to determine what information to record in the birth certificate .
In the view of the Federal Court of Justice, the children ’s interests coincided to some extent with th e general interest in ensuring the reliability and consistency of the civil registration system and in ensuring legal certainty.
Furthermore, t he Court endorsed the approach of the domestic courts that the right to gender identity of the parents could be limited by the right of the child to know his origins, to be brought up by both parents and to be attached to them in a stable manner.
The legal attachment of the child to his parents according to their reproductive functions allow ed the child to be attached in a stable and immutable manner to a mother and a father who would not change, even in the not only theoretical case, where the transgender parent applied for the annulment of the decision to change their gender (§§ 123-127) .
Moreover , there had been a limited number of situations that could lead, when presenting a child ’s birth certificate, to the disclosure of the transgender identity of the parents.
In particular, precautions had been in place to reduce the inconvenience to which tra nsgender parents might be exposed (§§ 130-133) .
In light of these factors, the Court did not find a violation of Article 8 of the Convention .",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[70, 71, 72, 50, 124, 126, 140]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court balanced the wide margin of appreciation of the respondent State and the best interests of the child in the case of O.H. and G.H. v.

"How does the margin of appreciation, positive obligations, and the requirement of effectiveness in the application of rights justify the Court's decision in B and C v. Switzerland that returning an LGBTI individual to a non-European state where they would be at risk of ill-treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation amounts to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention?","The Court has interpreted the above -mentioned obligations to require that an LGBTI person , risking persecution (amounting to treatment contrary to Article s 2 or 3 of the Convention) on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity , may not be sent back to their country of origin.
The Court has held that a person ’s sexual orientation forms a fundamental part of his or her identity and that no one may be obliged to conceal his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid persecution ( I.K. v. Switzerland (dec.), 2017, § 24).
Of particular relevance is the case of B and C v. Switzerland , 2020, which concerned the case of a gay man (in a same -sex relationship) challenging his deportation to a country (The Gambia) where he would be at risk of ill -treatment because of his sexual orientation.
The Court held , for the first time, that returning applicant s to a non -European state where they would be at risk of ill -treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation amounted to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.
In particular, it concluded that the domestic courts which, having taken the view that it was not likely that the first applican t’s sexual orientation would come to the attention of the Gambian authorities or other persons, had not engaged in an assessment on the availability of State protection against harm emanating from non -State actors and had not sufficiently assessed the risks of ill -treatment for the first applicant as a homosexual person in Gambia.
Where a difference in treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation the State ’s margin of appreciation is narrow ( Karner v. Austria , 2003 , § 41; Kozak v.

"Based on the provided legal doctrines and facts, can a post-operative transsexual who has undergone gender re-assignment surgery expect legal recognition for their gender in a Contracting State, and what factors would the Court consider in determining whether there is a positive obligation on the State to provide such recognition?","In determining whether or not such an obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance which has to be struck between the general interest and the interests of the individual : in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation ( B. v. France , 1992, § 44; Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014 , § 67; O.H. and G.H. v. Germany , 2023, §§ 109 -111).
In the context of claims brought by LGBTI persons the Court has found , for example , that there is a positive obligation to ensure the right of a post -operative transsexual, to respect for her private life, in particular through legal recognition for her gender re -assignment (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, §§ 71-93; Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006, §§ 39-44; departing from previous case -law such as Rees v. the United Kingdom , 1986; Cossey v. the United Kingdom , 1990; Sheffield and Horsham , 1998 ).
In assessing the situation in Italy, the Court held that there was a positive obligation to ensure that the applicants, same -sex couple s in stable unions, or same - sex couples married in a foreign State, have available a specific legal framework providing for the recognition and protection of their same -sex unions ( Oliari and Others v. Italy , 2015, § 185; Orlandi and Others v. Italy , 2017, § 210).
The scope of the margin of appreciation allowed to States will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background (Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014 , § 109).
While Article 8 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as guaranteeing an unconditional right to gender reassignment surgery, transgenderism is recognised internationally as a medical condition which warrants treatment to assist the persons concerned ( Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, § 81; Y.Y v. Turkey , 2015 , § 65).
The health services of most of the Contracting States recognise this condition and provide or permit treatment, including irreversible gender reassignment surgery ( ibid. ).
On several occasions the Court held that a post -operative transgender applicant may claim to be a victim of a breach of his or her right to respect for private life contrary to Article 8 due to the lack of legal recognition of his or her change of gender ( Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014, § 59; Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006 , § 40).
Whilst affording a certain margin of appreciation to States in this field, the Court has held that States are required (a positive obligation under Article 8 ) to implement the recognition of the gender change in post -operative transgender persons through, inter alia , amendments to their civil -status data, with its ensuing consequences ( Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, §§ 71-93; Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006 , §§ 39-44; departing from the previous case -law such as Rees v. the United Kingdom , 1986; Cossey v. the United Kingdom , 1990; and Sheffield and Horsham , 1998 ).
This positive obligation was later extended to transgender persons, irrespective of their post -operative status, as explained more in detail below (see for example, A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France , 2017 ; X and Y v. Romania , 2021 ).",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[46, 47, 48, 56, 61, 76, 83]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the question by referencing relevant legal doctrines and cases.

How does the Court's concept of margin of appreciation and positive obligations affect the examination of lawfulness and justification for the deprivation of an individual's liberty under Article 5 of the Convention?,"The review required under Article 5 § 3, being intended to establish whether the deprivation of the individual ’s liberty is justified, must be sufficiently wide to encompass the various circumstances militating for or against detention ( Aquilina v. Malta [GC], 1999, § 52).
Three strands of reasoning may be identified as running through the Court ’s case -law: the exhaustive nature of the exceptions, which must be interpreted strictly and which do not allow for the broad range of justifications under other provisions (Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention in particular); the repeated emphasis on the lawfulness of the detention, both procedural and substantive , requiring scrupulous adherence to the rule of law; and the importance of the promptness or speediness of the requisite judicial controls (under Article 5 § § 3 and 4) (Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 312; S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, § 73; Buzadji v. the Republic of Moldova [GC], 2016, § 84).
Article 5 § 1 thus does not merely refer back to domestic law, it also relates to the “quality of the law” which implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application.
Factors relevant to this assessment of the “quality of law” – which are referred to in some cases as “safeguards against arbitrariness” – will include the existence of clear legal provisions for ordering detention, for extending detention, and for setting time -limits for detention; and the existence of an effective remedy by which the applicant can contest the “lawfulness” and “length” of his continuing detention (J.N. v. the United Kingdom , 2016, § 77).
Article 5 § 4 entitles an arrested or detained person to bring proceedings for review by a court of the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of Article 5 § 1, of his or her deprivation of liberty ( Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, § 128; Idalov v. Russia [GC], 2012, § 161; Reinprecht v. Austria , 2005, § 31).
The notion of “lawfulness” under Article 5 § 4 has the same meaning as in Article 5 § 1, so that the arrested or detained person is entitled to a review of the “lawfulness” of his detention in the light not only of the requirements of domestic law but also of the Convention, the general principles embodied therein and the aim of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, § 128; Suso Musa v. Malta , 2013, § 50; see also A.M. v. France , 2016, § 40-41, concerning the required scope of judicial review under Article 5 § 1 (f)).
However, the court cannot treat as irrelevant, or disregard, concrete facts invoked by the deta inee and capable of putting into doubt the existence of the conditions essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty ( Ilijkov v. Bulgaria , 2001, § 94).
If the court fails to give adequate reasons, or gives repeated stereotyped decisions which provide no answer to the arguments of the applicant, this may disclose a violation by depriving the guarantee under Article 5 § 4 of its substance ( G.B. and Others v. Turkey , 2019, § 176).",4,5,4,5,4,,guide_art_5,"[196, 197, 198, 26, 34, 250, 261]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court's concept of margin of appreciation and positive obligations affect the examination of lawfulness and justification for the deprivation of an individual's liberty under Article 5 of the Convention.

How does the margin of appreciation apply to the State's discretion in implementing a pedagogical and educational system for the detention of minors in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (d) and ensure the effective application of rights?,"If the State has chosen a system of educational supervision involving a deprivation of liberty, it is obliged to put in place appropriate institutional facilities which meet the security and educational demands of that system in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 5 § 1 d) (A. and Others v. Bulgaria , 2011, § 69; D.G. v. Ireland , 2002, § 79).
Regarding implementation of a pedagogical and educational system, the State is to be afforded a certain margin of appreciation ( D.L. v. Bulgaria , 2016, § 77).
The Court does not consider that a juvenile holding facility itself constitutes “educational supervision”, if no educational activities are provided ( Ichin and Others v. Ukraine , 2010, § 39).
According to the travaux préparatoires , this provision was intended to cover detention of a minor prior to civil or administrative proceedings, while the detention in connection wit h criminal proceedings was intended to be covered by Article 5 § 1 (c).
The first limb of Article 5 § 1 d) authorises the deprivation of a minor ’s liberty in his or her own interests, irrespective of the question whether he or she is suspected of having committed a criminal offence or is simply a child “at risk” ( D.L. v. Bulgaria , 2016, § 71).
Such supervision must embrace many aspects of the exercise, by the authority, of parental rights for the benefit and protection of the person concerned ( P. and S. v. Poland , 2012, § 147; Ichin and Others v. Ukraine , 2010, § 39; D.G. v. Ireland , 2002, § 80).
“Educational supervision” must nevertheless contain an important core schooling aspect so that schooling in line with the normal school curriculum should be standard practice for all detained minors, even when they are placed in a temporary detention centre for a limited period of time, in order to avoid gaps in their education ( Blokhin v. Russia [GC], 2016, § 170).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_5,"[109, 110, 111, 103, 104, 105]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the question by discussing the margin of appreciation in relation to the State's discretion in implementing a pedagogical and educational system for the detention of minors.

"How does the principle of legal certainty apply to the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law, and what measures must be in place to satisfy the standard of ""lawfulness"" set by the Convention?","Where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied.
It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Conve ntion, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail ( Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, § 92; Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], 2013, § 125; Creangă v. Romania , 2012, § 120; Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], 2010, § 80).

How does the Court's deference to domestic authorities in assessing the evidence and findings of fact impact its scrutiny of alleged violations of Article 3 of the Convention?,"In cases of alleged violations of Article 3 of the Convention, it must, in its assessment of the evidence, apply a particularly through scrutiny.
Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a r ule, it is for these courts to assess the evidence before them.
While in Article 3 cases the Court is prepared to be more critical of the conclusions of the domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the finding s of fact reached by those courts ( Cestaro v. Italy , 2015 , § 164 and the cases cited therein).
Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention.
The burden of proof is then on the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim ( Salman v. Turkey [GC], 2000 , § 100).

Even though challenging physical exercise may be part and parcel of military discipline, the Court has stressed that, to remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention, it should not go beyond the level above which it would put in danger the health and well -being of conscripts or undermine their human dignity ( Chember v.

"How does the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in cases where a person suffering from serious illness is facing deportation without any assessment of their Article 8 rights, taking into account the doubts about the availability of appropriate medical treatment in their country of origin?","The proposed deportation of a person suffering from serious illness to his country of origin in face of doubts as to the availability of appropriate medical treatment there, without any assessment of his Article 8 rights, would constitute a violation of Article 8 (Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, §§ 221-226).
Moreover, where a person with serious mental health problems is facing deportation following a criminal conviction, his or her state of his health should be taken into account as one of the balancing factors, including its impact on culpability and the impact of treatment on the risk of reoffending ( Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, §§ 190-202) .
Where relevant arguments concerning the proportionality of the interference have been raised by the applicants, the domestic courts should examine them in detail and provide adequate reasons ( Ahmadov v. Azerbaijan , 2020, § 46).
The Court emphasises the quality of the decision -making procedure ( Salontaji -Drob njak v. Serbia , 2009, §§ 144-145).
Where there is an arguable claim that expulsion threatens to interfere with a non -citizen ’s right to respect for his private and family life, Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention requires that States must make available to the individual concerned the effective possibility of challenging the deportation or refusal of residence order and of having the relevant issues examined with sufficient procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality ( De Souza Ribeiro v. France [GC], 2012, § 83;
Where expulsions are challenged on the basis of alleged interference with private and family life, it is not imperative, in order for a remedy to be effective, that it should have automatic suspensive effect ( De Souza Ribeiro v. France [GC], 2012, § 83).
Nevertheless, in immigration matters, where there is an arguable claim that expulsion th reatens to interfere with the alien ’s right to respect for his or her private and family life, Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention requires that States must make available to the individual concerned the effective possibility of chal lenging the deportation or refusal of residence order and of having the relevant issues examined with sufficient procedural safeguards and thoroughness by an appropriate domestic forum offering adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality ( M. and Others v.

"How does the margin of appreciation apply in relation to the State's discretion to regulate private activities, such as hunting wild animals with hounds?","The right to personal development and personal autonomy does not cover every public activity a person might seek to engage in with other human beings (for example, the hunting of wild animals with hounds in Friend and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2009, §§ 40-43; and the right to hunt on one ’s own land, or on the land of others, is not as such protected by any provision of the Convention, Advisory Opinion P16 -2021 -002, § 80).
A State ’s margin of appreciation will tend to be relatively narrow where the right at stake is crucial to the individual ’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights ( Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC] , 2016, § 178; see also, for instance, Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014, §§ 67-68 and the cas e-law references cited ).
In so far as, in this area, the questions in issue may depend on a multitude of local factors and pertain to the choice of town and country planning policies, the Contracting States in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ( Noack and Others v. Germany (dec.) , 2000 ; see also the wide margin of appreciation for housing matters (L.F. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2022, § 40) and more specifically access to water and sanitation , Hudorovič and Others v. Slovenia , 2020 , §§ 141, 144, 158 and the references cited therein , or road works of importance to the local community, Faulkner and McDonagh v. Ireland (dec.), 2022, § 109).
However, it remains open to the Court to conclude that there has been a manifest error of appreciation ( Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2001, § 92).",5,5,4,5,4,,guide_art_8,"[274, 275, 276, 35, 118, 328, 462, 509]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation in relation to the State's discretion to regulate private activities, specifically hunting wild animals with hounds.

"In the case of an individual living in a council house whose right of occupation has ended under domestic law, but who has occupied the house for several years, can their occupancy still be considered a ""home"" under the protection of Article 8 § 1 of the ECHR?","It may apply to a council house occupied by the applicant as tenant, even if, under domestic law, the right of occupation had ended ( McCann v. the United Kingdom , 2008, § 46), or to occupancy for several years (Brežec v.

How does the margin of appreciation apply in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person's only home?,"In such proceedings, the national courts must have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the case -law principles , in which instance the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment ( Ivanova and Cherkezov v. Bulgaria , 2016, § 53 (violation) ; see also Simonova v. Bulgaria , 202 3, §§ 51 -52, and Alif Ahmadov and Others v. Azerbaijan , 2023, §§ 61 -64, but compare and contrast, Szczypiński v. Poland (dec .), 2022, §§ 66-71, where the courts did balance, on the one hand, the interest of the applicant in keeping his house and, on the other, the interests of society).
Based on their decisions, the Court must be satisfied that domestic authorities assessed all the relevant circumstances and adequately addressed the applicant ’s arguments regarding his individual situation ( Kaminskas v. Lithuania , 2020, §§ 58-65).
In such cases , the balancing exercise is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned, and can normally only be examined on a case by case basis (Ivanova and Cherkezov v. Bulgaria , 2016, § 54).
When determining whether an interference was “necessary” the Court will consider the margin of appreciation left to the State au thorities, but it is a duty of the respondent State to demonstrate the existence of a pressing social need behind the interference ( Piechowicz v. Poland , 2012, § 212).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_art_8,"[32, 33, 34, 118, 462, 467, 468, 469]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation in cases involving the loss of a person's only home.

How does the margin of appreciation apply when assessing the necessity of interference with the right to privacy in the context of secret surveillance measures?,"It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on covert surveillance measures, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated.
The domestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which, and the conditions upon which, public authorities are empowered to resort to any such measures (Malone v. the United Kingdom , 1984, § 67; Leander v. Sweden , 1987, § 51; Valenzuela Contreras v. Spain, 1998, § 46; Weber and Saravia v. Germany (dec. ), 2006, § 93; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdjiev v. Bulgaria, 2007, § 75; Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], 2015, § 229).
In addition, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference ( Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], 2015, § 230).
Whatever surveillance system the authorities use, the existence of adequate and sufficient guarantees against abuse is essential.
The Court considers that powers of secret surveillance of citizens are tolerable only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions ( Klass and Others v. Germany , 1978, § 42; Szabó and Vissy v. Hungary , 2016, § § 72-73).
Such interference must be supported by relevant and sufficient reasons and must be proportionate to the legitimate aim or aims pursued ( Segerstedt - Wiberg and Others v. Sweden , § 88).
In the framework of secret surveillance measures, review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated.
In a field where abuse is potentially so easy in individual cases and could have such harmful consequences for democratic society as a whole, it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure ( ibid. , § 233; Klass and Others v. Germany , 1978, § § 55-56).",5,5,4,5,3,5,guide_data_protection,"[386, 387, 388, 93, 129, 324]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation when assessing the necessity of interference with the right to privacy in the context of secret surveillance measures. It covers various aspects such as the need for clear rules, the requirement for sufficient clarity in domestic law, the importance of guarantees against abuse, the tolerability of secret surveillance powers, the need for relevant and sufficient reasons, and the role of review and supervision.

How does the concept of margin of appreciation relate to the State's discretion in regulating the disclosure of personal data?,"In cases which raise the issue of the protection of personal data, the Court has found that the State’s margin of appreciation is broader: where there is no consensus in the member States of the Council of Europe as to the importance of the interest at stake, or the best means of protecting it (Odièvre v. France [GC], 2003, § 47; Breyer v. Germany , 2020, § 108); where the purely financial data at stake w ere not closely related to the applicant’s identity (G.S.B. v. Switzerland , 2015, § 93); and, lastly, in matters of national security (Leander v. Sweden , 1987, § 59).
By contrast, the margin of appreciation afforded to national authorities was found to be narrower where, for example, personal data subject to automatic processing which considerably facilitated their access and dissemination could harm a person ’s reputation and render his daily life more difficult (Khelili v. Switzerland, 2011, §§ 64, 70).
The same consideration is especially valid for the protection of categories of sensitive data , in particular DNA information, which contains the person ’s genetic make- up and is of great importance to both the person concerned and his or her family (S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, §§ 102-103).
In respect of retention regimes for the biometric data of convicted persons, the duration of the retention period is not necessarily conclusive in assessing whether a State has overstepped the acceptable margin of appreciation in establishing the relevant regime –- the existence and functioning of certain safeguards is decisive ( Gaughran v. the United Kingdom , 2020, § 88).
W hen States themselves set retention limits for the biometric data of convicted persons , or indeed decide that data retention should be indefinite, they are putting themselves at the limit of their margin of appreciation and must ensure the existence of certain effective safeguards ( ibid. , § 88).
The existence or lack of independent review of the justification for retention of the information according to defined criteria such as the seriousness of the offence, the strength of the suspicion against the person, previous convictions and any other special circumstances , is a major safeguard for ensuring the proportionality of data retention periods ( ibid. , § 94; S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 119; B.B. v. France , 2009, § 68; Gardel v. France , 2009, § 69; M.B. v. France , 2009, § 60).
Prior consent by data subjects to the transmission, disclosure or publication of their data is an important, although not a decisive, element in determining in a given case whether such operations amount to interference with their right to respect for private life ( M.S. v. Sweden , 1997, § § 31, 35; M.M. v. the United Kingdom , 2012, § § 186, 189) or if they can be considered as being “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 (Radu v. the Republic of Moldova, 2014, § 27; Mockutė v. Lithuania, 2018, § 101).
The Court found a violation of Article 8 in several cases in which the disclosure of personal data by the data processor had occurred without the consent of the data subject ( Radu v. the Republic of Moldova, 2014, § § 30, 32; Mockutė v. Lithuania, 2018, § § 103, 106; Peck v. the United Kingdom , 2003, § § 85-87; Sõro v. Estonia , 2015, § § 17-19, 64).
The Court holds that where a State pushes its margin of appreciation to the extremes by maximising its powers in the sphere of data retention, that is, by storing data indefinitely, it is decisive that there should be effective safeguards providing for the deletion of personal data when their continued retention has become disproportionate ( Catt v. the United Kingdom , 2019, § 119; Gaughran v. the United Kingdom , 2020, § 94).
In a case in which the biometric data and photographs of the applicant, who had been convicted of driving with excess alcohol , had been retained under a policy of indefinite storage of the personal data of anyone found guilty of a criminal offence, the Court found a violation of Article 8 (ibid. , § 98).
There was no provision allowing the applicant to apply to have the data concerning him deleted if conserving the data no longer appeared necessary in view of the nature of the offence, the age of the person concerned, the length of time that has elapsed and the person ’s current personality.
The police could only delete the biometric data and photographs of convicted persons in exceptional cases.
Review possibilities were so narrow as to be almost hypothetical ( ibid. , § 94).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_data_protection,"[268, 269, 270, 43, 77, 212, 239, 307]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of margin of appreciation relates to the State's discretion in regulating the disclosure of personal data.

"In environmental cases, how does the broad margin of appreciation granted to States intersect with the requirement to assess the necessity of an interference with individuals' rights?","Having regard to the broad margin of appreciation granted to S tates in environmental cases , it is primarily incumbent on the national authorities to ass ess the “necessity ” of an interference (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001; Giacomelli v. Italy , 2006 , § 80; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom , 2012, § 218), as regards both the legal framework and the specific implementing measures (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001).
How ever, it remains open to the Court to conclude that there has been a manifest error of appreciation by the national authorities (Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001).
It is incumbent on it to assess whether the interference was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, and in particular whether, having regard to the State’s broad margin of appreciation in the environmental sphere , a fair balance was struck between the competing interests (Flamenbaum and Others v. France , 2012 , § 150).
In so doing the Court must have regard to all the measures implemented by the authorities to limit pollution and disturb ances ( Flamenbaum and Others v. France , 2012 , § 153).
In some cases it acknowledges that the authorities have an inevitably limited choice of measures to meet a “ pressing social need ” to deal with the possible negative consequences of interfering in citizens ’ private lives (Ruano Morcuende v. Spain (dec.), 2005 ).
In environmental matters, as in many other areas, the choice of which positive measures to be implement ed by the States, in principle, falls within their margin of appreciation ( Fadeyeva v. Russia , 2005, § 96; Greenpeace E.V. and Others v. Germany (dec.), 2009; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine , § 141, 2011; Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 66; Kotov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 128).
Whilst the State is required to give due consideration to individual interests, the respect for which it is obliged to secure by virtue of Article 8, it must in principle be left a choice between different ways and means of meeting this obligation.
The Court ’s supervisory function being of a subsidiary nature, it is limited to reviewing whether or not the particular solution adopted can be regarded as striking a fair balance ( Hatton and Others v. United Kingdom [GC], 2003, § 123; Zammit Maempel v. Malta , 2011, § 66) or whether the reasons given by the State to justify the measures taken are relevant and sufficient (Kotov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 128).
In taking, for general -interest purposes, action amounting to an interference in the right to property , States enjoy a broad margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement in achieving the aim in question and to appraising the proportionality of those means to th e aim.
The Court has emphasised that that is particularly the case where the general interest pursued concerns environmental protection ( Hamer v. Belgium , 2007 , § 78; Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Matczyńsk i v. Poland, 2015, § § 105-106; S.C. Fiercolect Impex S.R.L. v. Romania , 2016, § 67; Tumeliai v. Lithuania, 2018, § 72).
Similarly the Court has pointed out that the marge of appreciation is broader where the alleged interference in the right to respect for property relates to spatial planning and environmental protection policies (Depalle v. France [GC], 2010, § § 84 and 87; Malfatto and Mieille v. France , 2016, § 64; Barcza and Others v. Hungary , 2016 , § 46; O’Sullivan McCarthy Mussel Development Ltd v. Irlande , 2018 , § 124) ; (Bērziņš and Others v. Latvia, 2021, § 90).
Apart from the broader margin of appreciation mentioned above , the case -law principles relating to the right to respect for property apply in a fairly standard manner to measures restricting that right which are aimed at environmental conservation (see Guide on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).",5,3,4,4,4,,guide_environment,"[108, 109, 110, 117, 173, 175]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the broad margin of appreciation granted to States intersects with the requirement to assess the necessity of an interference with individuals' rights in environmental cases. It discusses the primary responsibility of national authorities to assess the necessity of an interference, but also highlights that the Court can intervene if there is a manifest error of appreciation. The answer further explains that the Court must assess whether the interference was proportionate and whether a fair balance was struck between competing interests. It also mentions that the choice of positive measures falls within the State's margin of appreciation, but the State must still consider individual interests. The answer concludes by stating that the Court's supervisory function is limited to reviewing the fairness and relevance of the measures taken by the State.

"How does the margin of appreciation and positive obligations apply in relation to the State's discretion to prohibit filming without consent, both in the case of attempted covert filming of a minor (Söderman v. Sweden) and the covert filming of a journalist (Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan)?","Söderman v. Sweden [GC] , 2013, concerned the attempted covert filming of a 14-year -old girl by her stepfather while she was naked, and her complaint that the Swedish legal system, which at the time did not prohibit filming without someone ’s consent, had not protected her against the violation of her personal integrity.
However, the Court found that the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation to ensure the adequate protection of the applicant ’s private life by carrying out an effective criminal investigation into the very serious interferences with her private life.
While the choice of the means to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of protection against acts of individuals is, in princip le, within the State ’s margin of appreciation, effective deterrence against grave acts, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake, requires efficient criminal law provisions.
The State therefore has a positive obligation inherent in Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to enact criminal law provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through effective investigation and prosecution ( M.C. v. Bulga ria, 2003) .
Children and other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to effective protection ( X and Y v. the Netherlands , 1985, §§ 23-24 and 27; August v. the United Kingdom (dec.) , 2003 ; M.C. v. Bulgaria , 2003) .
The Court has also found the following acts to be both grave and an affront to human dignity: an intrusion into the applicant ’s home in the form of unauthorised entry into her flat and installation of wires and hidden video cameras inside the flat; a serious, flagrant and extraordinarily intense invasion of her private life in the form of unauthorised fi lming of the most intimate aspects of her private life, which had taken place in the sanctity of her home, and subsequent public dissemination of those video images; and receipt of a letter threatening her with public humiliation.
Furthermore, the applicant is a well -known journalist and there was a plausible link between her professional activity and the aforementioned intrusions, whose purpose was to silence her ( Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan , 2019, § 116).
The Court, for example, found a violation of the right to private life due to the absence of clear statutory provisions criminalising the act of covertly filming a naked child ( Söderman v. Sweden [GC], 2013, § 117).
In the absence of any real restriction or review of either the authorisation of an enhanced check or the police measures carried out during an enhanced check, the Court is of the view that the domestic law did not provide adequate safeguards to offer the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference.",4,5,5,4,5,Huge confusion in terms of legal notions,guide_art_8,"[195, 196, 197, 9, 21, 467, 509]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in relation to the State's discretion to prohibit filming without consent in the cases of Söderman v.

How did the Court apply the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in relation to the State's discretion when examining the disciplinary sanctions imposed on judges in the Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria and Juszczyszyn v. Poland cases?,"In Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, disciplinary sanctions were imposed on the applicant, a judge, on account of serious delays in case -processing.
Without questioning the existence of a legitimate aim for the impugned sanctions (namely, that of ensuring the proper functioning of the justice system), the Court found that they had also pursued the ulterior purpose of punishing and intimidating the applicant.
In particular, as publicly announced by Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights the SJC Inspector General, the audit which gave rise to the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been a response to criticism by judges, including the BUJ, of the appointment of the new president of the Sofia City Court (a judge known to be a close friend of the Minister of the Interior).
Faced with a plurality of purposes, the Court turned to the question of whether the ulterior purpose was predominant.
The Court eventually concluded that the ulterior purpose was the predominant one, havin g regard to the above chain of the events, the clearly hostile opinions expressed towards the BUJ and other NGOs by the SJC, as well as the exceptional severity of the decision to dismiss the applicant.
The Court found particularly alarming the intention t o use disciplinary procedure to retaliate against the applicant whose activities had been neither unlawful, nor incompatible with the judicial code of ethics (§§ 205-212) . Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights
Where the case Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights circumstances indicate that such proceedings and the imposed sanctions are tainted by ulterior motives, the Court will scrutinise whether the domestic judicial review has properly addressed this issue, in light of the applicant ’s allegations ( Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 212).
In the first place, the Court had regard to the above chain of the events which tended to indicate that the main reason for the audits had been a wish to penalise the applicant.
The above factors are also of relevance in the context of disciplinary proceedings ( Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, §§ 205-213; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § § 322-337).
On this basis, the Court considered t he identified ulterior purpose to be predominant, so as to amount to a breach of Article 18 in conjunction with Article 10 ( Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, §§ 205- 213).
In Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, the Court found that the disciplinary suspension of the applicant judge had pursued predominantly , not the legitimate aim relied upon by the Government, but the ulterior purpose of sanctioning him for, and dissuading from, verifying via judicial order the lawfulness of the appointment of judges in the context of the wide -scale reforms of the Polish judiciary.
Thirdly, the suspension decision was taken by a body that lacked independence and, on its merits , was incompatible with the principle of judicial independence and manifestly unreasonable .
It disregarded fundamental findings by the Court of Justice of the European Union ’s (CJEU) and by the Polish Supreme Court.
Fourthly, the Court had regard to the adoption of the legislation which coincided with the proceedings against the applicant and introduced new disciplinary offences for judges, including for actions questioning judicial appointments , and to new rulings by the Constitutional Court which excluded the possibility for courts to review a judge ’s right to adjudicate on the basis of the manner of his appointment.
In sum, these developments showed the authorities ’ determination to demonstrate that any such actions would expose judges to sanctions, and therefore pointed to the predominance of the ulterior purpose behind the applicant ’s suspension.
In so concluding, the Court also relied on the relevant opinion of the Venice Commission, the CJEU ’s judgment in Commission v. Poland (Disciplinary regime for judges), as well as on the resolution of the PACE.",3,5,4,4,3,Mismatch: the answer does not address the question well,guide_art_18,"[140, 141, 142, 87, 115]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a detailed analysis of how the Court applied the margin of appreciation and positive obligations in relation to the State's discretion when examining the disciplinary sanctions imposed on judges in the Miroslava Todorova v.

"To what extent does the margin of appreciation allow the State to apply reasonable measures in cases involving the preservation of life and the decriminalization of euthanasia, considering the need for the protection of individuals' rights and the diversity of approaches within the member states?","However, in order to be compatible with Article 2, that decriminalisation had to be accompanied by suitable and sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse and thus secure respect for the right to life ( Mortier v. Belgium , 2022, § § 138 -139)
As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres ( Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, §§ 134-135; Vilnes and Others v. Norway , 2013, § 220; Brincat and Others v. Malta, 2014, § 101).
In the case of Lambert and Others v. France [GC], 2015, which concerned the decision of the authorities to discontinue nutrition and hydration allowing a patient in state of total dependence to be kept alive artificially , the Court noted that no consensus existed among the Council of Europe member States in favour of permitting the withdrawal of artificial life -sustaining treatment, although the majority of States appear to allow it.
In this respect, it noted that while the detailed arrangements governing the withdrawal of treatment vary from one country to another, there was nevertheless a consensus as to the paramount importance of the patient ’s wishes in the decision -making process, however those wishes are expressed.
It therefore considered that in this sphere concerning the end of life, as in that concerning the beginning of life, States must be afforded a margin of appreciation, not just as to whether or not to permit the withdrawal of artificial life -sustaining treatment and the detailed arrangements governing such withdrawal, but also as regards the means of striking a balance between the protection of patients ’ right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their private life and their personal autonomy.
The Court underlined, however, that this margin of appreciation is not unlimited and it reserves the power to review whether or not the State has complied with its obligations under Article 2 ( §§ 147-148).",5,4,4,4,3,,guide_art_2,"[73, 74, 75, 25, 41, 76, 77]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v1,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the margin of appreciation in cases involving the preservation of life and the decriminalization of euthanasia.

"How does the Court apply the criteria of proportionality, purpose of the order, and feasibility of compliance in justifying the detention of an individual who failed to pay a court fine, as illustrated in the case of Velinov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (2013) under the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (b)?","The domestic authorities must strike a fair balance between the importance in a democratic society of securing compliance with a lawful order of a court, and the importance of the right to liberty.
Factors to be taken into consideration include the purpose of the order, the feasibility of compliance with the order, and the duration of the detention.
The issue of proportionality assumes particular significance in the overall scheme of things ( Gatt v. Malta , 2010, § 40).
The Convention organs have applied the first limb of Article 5 § 1 (b) to cases concerning, for example, a failure to pay a court fine ( Velinov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , 2013; Airey v. Ireland , Commission decision of 7 July 1977 ), a refusal to undergo a medical examination concerning mental health ( X. v. Germany , Commission decision of 10 December 1975), or a blood test ordered by a court ( X. v. Austria , Commission decision of 13 December 1979 ), a failure to observe residence restrictions ( Freda v. Italy , Commission decision of 7 October 1980 ), a failure to comply with a decision to hand over children to a parent ( Paradis v. Germa ny (dec.) , 2007 ), a failure to observe binding -over orders ( Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom , 1998), a breach of bail conditions ( Gatt v.

How does the sequence of arrests and the changing purpose of the measures taken against the applicant correspond to the prohibition of restrictions on rights for an improper purpose under Article 18 of the Convention?,"In the first place , the sequence of arrests disclosed a certain pattern: the applicant had been arrested seven times in a relatively short period (two years) and in a virtually identical manner.
In particular, although in the first four episodes the applicant was one of the leaders of the gatherings, he had not played any special role in the subsequent episodes.
Secondly, in light of the wider context, the authorities had become increasingly aware during the seven episodes t hat the impugned practices were incompatible with the Convention (see, notably, the Court ’s similar findings with regard to an earlier demonstration in Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia and with regard to the parallel criminal proceedings against the applicant in Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia and Navalnyye v. Russia ).
In particular, legislative changes (examined in and adopted since Lashmankin and Others v.

How does the Court justify the distinction between intentional gatherings causing disorder and unintentional gatherings causing no nuisance in relation to the legitimate aim of preventing disorder?,"The Court has also held that the legitimate aim of “the prevention of disorder” must be interpreted narrowly ( Navalnyy v.

The Court confirmed such interference to be in pursuit of the legitimate aim of “prevention of disorder”.
The Court, howev er, did not accept the existence of the legitimate aim of “prevention of disorder” in relation to events where the gatherings were unintentional and caused no nuisance ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018 , §§ 124-126).
In the Court ’s case -law, content -based restrictions on freedom of assembly are subject to stricter scrutiny than restrictions of a technical nature.
It is very rare for a gathering to be legitimately banned in relation to the substance of the message which its participants wish to convey, especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering ( Navalnyy, v. Russia [GC], 2018 , § 86, and Primov and Others v. Russia , 2014 , §§ 134- 135).

What are the criteria under the Convention for applying the rights enshrined therein?,"Thus, when investigating violent incidents triggered by suspected racist attitudes, the State authorities are required to take all reasonable action to ascertain whether there were racist motives and to establish whether feelings of hatred or prejudices based on a person ’s ethnic origin played a role in the events.
Treating racially motivated violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases lacking any racist overtones would be tantamount to turning a blind eye to the specific nature of acts which are particularly destructive of fundamental human rights (Abdu v. Bulgaria , 2014 , § 44).
The said obligation is part of the responsibility incumbent on Sta tes under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 3, but it is also an aspect of the procedural obligations flowing from Article 3 of the Convention ( M.F. v. Hungary , 2017 , § 73).
It also applies where a given type of treatment incompatible with Article 3 is inflicted by a private individual ( Abdu v. Bulgaria , 2014 , § 44).
Moreover, such an investigation concerns not only acts of violence based on a victim ’s actual or perceived personal status or characteristics , but also acts of violence based on a victim ’s actual or presumed association or affiliation with another person who actually or presumably possesses a particular status or protected characteristic ( Škorjanec v. Croatia , 2017, § 56).
Proving racial motivation will often be difficult in practice.
The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumst ances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of racially motivated violence ( Antayev and Others v. Russia , 2014, § 122).
The Court ’s approach to the interpretation of Article 3 must be guided by the fact that the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings require that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective.
Any interpretation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed has to be consistent with the general spirit of the Convention, an instrument designed to maintain and promote the ideas and values of a democratic society (Soering v. the United Kingdom , 1989, § 87).
Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic societies.
Indeed, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a value of civilisation closely bound up with respect for human dignity ( Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], 2015 , § 81).
The prohibition in question is absolute, no derogation from it being permissible under Article 15 § 2 even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation or in the most difficult circumstances, such as the fight against terrorism and organised crime or influx of migrants and asylum -seekers , irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned (A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2009 , § 126; Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], 2014 , § 315; El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], 2012 , § 195 and Z.A. and Others v. Russia [GC], 2009, §§ 187- 188) or the nature of the alleged offence committed by him or her ( Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], 2006 , § 116 and Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], 2010, § 87).
However, the Court has also considered that States have positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, which comprise , firstly, an obligation to put in place a legislative and regulatory framework of protection; secondly, in certain well -defined circumstances, an obligation to take operational measures to protect specific individuals against a risk of treatment contrary t o that provision; and thirdly, an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into arguable claims of infliction of such treatment.
Generally, speaking, the first two aspects of these positive obligations are classified as “substantive”, while the third aspect corresponds to the State ’s procedural obligation (X and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2021 , § 178) .
Having regard to the fact that the Convention is a living instrument which must be interpreted in the light of present -day conditions, acts which were classified in the past as “inhuman and degrading treatment” as opposed to “torture” could be classified differently in future.
There are certain situations where the treatment complained of by the applicant can fall within the ambit of two or more articles of the Convention.
In such cases, depending on the circumstances, the Court may examine the complaint separately under each provision (see, for example, Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v. Belgium , 2006; and D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom , 2002 ) or in conjunction (see, for example, M.C. v. Bulgaria , 2003 ).
It may also consider it unnecessary to examine the same complaint under Article 8, if it finds a violation of Article 2 or 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], 2004 ; and Z and Others v. the Unite d Kingdom [GC], 2001 ).",3,4,4,3,4,Mismatch: the answer does not address the question well,guide_art_3,"[152, 153, 154, 1, 2, 4, 11, 23]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the criteria under the Convention for applying the rights enshrined therein.

It also noted that the applic ants had been un able to produce evidence to the effect that the operation of wind turbines near their properties or homes in Dunika parish would directly and seriously affect them , with the necessary degree of probability ; the mere mention of certain adverse effects arising from the operation of wind turbines in general was insufficient in that regard .
In Maatschap Smits and Others v. Netherlands (dec.), 2001, and Thibaut v. France (dec.), 2022, concerning plans for a railway line and an extra -high -voltage power line , respectively, the Court Guide on case -law of the Convention – Environment European Court of Human Rights 82/94 Updated : 31.08. 2023 accepted that the persons living along the projected routes , who had complained of the pollution, nuisance and health risks which that infrastructure would generate , could claim victim status .
The Court conclu ded that the authorities had deprived the procedural safeguards available to the applic ants of any useful effect .
For someone to lose his or her victim status , the domestic authorities must have found a violation and given a decision which constitutes adequate and sufficient redress for that violation (see Admissibility Guide , §§ 36-39).
The procedural mechanism provided for in domestic law to ensure the protection of individual right s, and in particular the obligation to conduct Guide on case -law of the Convention – Environment European Court of Human Rights 58/94 Updated : 31.08. 2023 an environmental impact assessment prior to any project with potentially harmful environmental consequences and the possibility for any citizens concerned to participate in the licensing procedure and to submit their own observations to the judicial authorities and, where appropriate, obtain an order for the suspension of a dangerous activity, had been deprived of useful effect in the instant case for a very long period .
The Court noted that the Norwegian High Court had ruled that before the applic ants had applied to the domestic courts the pollution levels had exceeded the legal limits of tolerable inconvenience .
Applicants consequently benefit from a practical and effective right of access to a tribunal ( De Geouffre de la Pradelle v. France , 1992, § § 27-35; Posti and Rahko v. Finland, 2002, § § 52-66; Geffre v. France (dec.), 2003 ; Alatulkkila and Others v. Finland, 2005, § § 49-54; De Mortemart v. France (dec.), 2017; Sakskoburggotski and Chrobok v.

Bulgaria (dec.), 2013, where the Court pointed out, in the context of the foundation of a national park, that the Convention did not guarantee access to a tribunal to challenge general policy decisions ).
However, the Court does to some extent accept the concept of a “potential victim ”.
Thus an applicant can claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention if he presents plausible and cogent evidence of the probable materialisation of a violation which will personally affect him (see the Practical Guide on Admissibility Criteria , §§ 30-31).",3,5,5,3,3,,guide_environment,"[143, 144, 145, 56, 166, 204, 205, 206]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a detailed explanation of how the Court differentiates between applicants and victims in environmental cases and the protections afforded to each.

What factors did the Court consider in the case of P.N. v. Germany when determining whether the storage of identification data from an adult offender for a maximum of five years violated the right to respect for private life under Article 8?,"In view of the relatively limited intrusiveness and duration of the collection of the identification data in question , the limited impact of the data retention on the applicant ’s daily life , the deletion of the data after five years, and the fact that the data was stored in a police database subject to safeguards and individualised review, the impugned measure had constituted a proportionate interference with the applicant ’s right to respect for his private life .
Conversely, the Court found no violation of Article 8 in several cases concerning the storage of the personal data of individuals convicted of sexual assault for a maximum thirty years, after which period the data was automatically deleted, because procedures had been introduced to enable the data to be deleted as soon as it was no longer relevant ( B.B. v. France , 2009, § 67; Gardel v. France , 2009, § 69; M.B. v. France , 2009, § 59).
In the case of P.N. v. Germany , 2020 (§ § 87-90), the Court found no violation of Article 8 with regard to the retention for five years, subject to guarantees and individualised review, of a repeat offender’s personal data for the purposes of identifying him following the commencement of fresh criminal proceedings against him .
In the case of P.N. v.

"In a case where individuals allege that their right to respect for their private lives has been infringed by secret monitoring measures, how does the Court determine whether there has been a violation of Article 8?","For systems which do not provide for notification of the person concerned of the measures taken against him, the fact that the individuals concerned consider that their right to respect for their private lives has been infringed by a secret monitoring measure can apply to an independent and impartial body even if they were not informed in advance that their communications had been intercepted was considered by the Court as providing an important safeguard, in a case in which it found no violation of Article 8 ( Kennedy v. the United Kingdom , 2010, § § 167, 169).
Conversely, where the remedies available under the domestic system are open solely to persons with a minimum of information on the impugned measure, the Court held that those concerned had not had an effective remedy against the secret monitoring measures, in breach of Article 8 ( Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], 2015, § § 293- 298, 305).
Besides the right to respect for private and family life, the home and correspondence guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention, which is the primary source of protection of personal data in the Convention system, issues linked to that protection may also come into play under other provisions of the Convention and its Protocols.
In such cases the Court ’s main task is to weigh up this protection and reconcile it with other rights and legitimate interests.
The Court has to date dealt with a large number of personal data operations conducted by the authorities or various privates agencies, assessing whether the data subject’ s “private life”, “home” and/or “correspondence” were infringed in a manner incompatible with Article 8.
In different contexts it has specified the scope of a number of rights on which legal and natural persons can rely in order to protect their personal data.
The Court has dealt with a considerable number of cases concerning the issue of personal data collection by means of various methods of secret surveillance.
Whatever surveillance system the authorities use, the existence of adequate and sufficient guarantees against abuse is essential.
The Court considers that powers of secret surveillance of citizens are tolerable only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions ( Klass and Others v. Germany , 1978, § 42; Szabó and Vissy v. Hungary , 2016, § § 72-73).
Such interference must be supported by relevant and sufficient reasons and must be proportionate to the legitimate aim or aims pursued ( Segerstedt - Wiberg and Others v. Sweden , § 88).
Domestic legislation must provide safeguards that are sufficiently 6
See also Guide to Article 8 of the Convention (right to respect for private and family life) . precise, effective and comprehensive in respect of the ordering and execution of surveillance measures and for the securing of potential redress (Szabó and Vissy v. Hungary , 2016, § 89).
In the first two judgments delivered in this sphere ( Halford v. the United Kingdom , 1997, § 44, and Copland v. the United Kingdom , 2007, § 41), the Court held that non -professional telephone calls from business premises are prima facie covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” for the purposes of Article 8.
It also considered that e- mails sent from work should be similarly protected under Article 8, as should information derived from the monitoring of personal Internet usage (Copland v. the United Kingdom , 2007, § 41).
Subsequently, the Court also specified that data clearly identified as private and stored by an employee in a computer provided to him by his employer for work purposes might also be covered by the “private life” concept ( Libert v. France , 2018, § 25).
Furthermore, a covert video recording showing the conduct of an employee at his workplace, without notification, also affects his “private life” ( Köpke v. Germany (dec.), 2010).
The Court has found violations of Article 8 in cases where it has noted a failure on the part of the domestic courts to en sure that an employer ’s implementation of surveillance measures was proportionate and accompanied by adequate and sufficient safeguards.
In the case of B ărbulescu v. Romania [GC] , 2017 (§ § 108-141), the national courts had failed to determine the specific reasons justifying the implementation of surveillance measures, whether the employee could have resorted to less intrusive measures vis-à-vis the employee’s private life and correspondence, or whether the employee had been notified in advance by his employer of the possible monitoring of his communications.
Conversely, in Libert v. France , 2018 (§ § 37-53) the Court found no violation of Article 8 regarding the opening of personal files stored in a work computer, the pornographic content of which had provided the grounds for the employee ’s dismissal.
It observed that domestic law as interpreted and applied by t he domestic court, had comprised adequate safeguards against arbitrariness, including the fact that the employer had only been allowed to open the files marked “personal” in the employee ’s presence.",5,5,4,4,4,,guide_data_protection,"[327, 328, 329, 126, 129, 153, 158]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court determines whether there has been a violation of Article 8 in cases where individuals allege that their right to respect for their private lives has been infringed by secret monitoring measures.

"In a case where an individual threatens to take their own life in plain view of State agents, and this threat is directly induced by the State agents' actions or demands, what positive obligation arises under Article 2 of the Convention and what measures are required of the State to prevent the imminent risk to the individual's life?","In a case where the applicant ’s wife set herself on fire in protest at a forced eviction, the Court held that, in a situation where an individual threatens to take his or her own life in plain view of State agents and, moreover, where this threat is an emotional reaction directly induced by the State agents ’ actions or demands, the latter should treat this threat with the utmost seriousness as constituting an imminent risk to that individual’s life, regardless of how unexpected that threat might have been. In such circumstances, if the St ate agents become aware of such a threat sufficient ly in advance, a positive obligation arises under Article 2 requiring them to prevent this threat from materialising by any means which are reasonable and feasible in the circumstances ( Mikayil Mammadov v. Azerbaijan, 2009, § 115).
It considered that they must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be en dangered by the inherent risks.
Among these preventive measures, a particular weight should be placed on the public ’s right to information, as established in the case -law of the Convention institutions and relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels ( Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC] , 2004, § 90; Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, § 132; Kolyadenko and Others v. Russia , 2012, § 159).
The Court has held that Article 2 of the Convention implies in certain well -defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual ( Osman v. the United Kingdom , 1998, § 115; Branko Tomaši ć and Others v. Croatia , 2009, § 50).
In this connection, any negligence displayed by the investigating or supervising authorities in the face of real and imminent threats to an identified individual’s life emanating from State agents who were acting outside their legal duties may entail a violation of the positive obligation to protect life (Gongadze v. Ukraine , 2005, § 170; Turluyeva v. Russia , 2013, §§ 100-101).
Since then the Court has accepted that this obligation arises in a variety of situations where an individual has sustained life -threatening injuries, died or has disappeared in violent or suspicious circumstances, irrespective of whether those allegedly responsible are State agents or private persons or are unknown or self- inflicted (see, for example, concerning inter -prisoner violence : Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 69; concerning homicides by prisoners benefiting from early release or social re -integration schemes : Maiorano and Others v. Italy , 2009, §§ 123-26; concerning high -profile assassinations : Kolevi v. Bulgaria, 2009, §§ 191-215; concerning domestic violence : Opuz v. Turkey , 2009, § 150; concerning suspicious deaths or disappearances : Iorga v. Moldova , 2010, § 26; Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC] , 2004, § 226; concerning suicide : Trubnikov v. Russia , 2005 ; Mosendz v. Ukraine , 2013, § 92; Vasîlca v. the Republic of Moldova, 2014, § 28).
This stems from Article 2 which imposes a duty on that State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law -enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provis ions.
This obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when there is reason to believe that an individual has sustained life -threatening injuries in suspicious circumstances, even where the presumed perpetrator of the fatal attack is not a State agent ( Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC] , 2015, § 171).",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_art_2,"[38, 39, 40, 17, 135, 136, 144]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the positive obligation that arises under Article 2 of the Convention in a case where an individual threatens to take their own life in plain view of State agents. It discusses the seriousness with which the threat should be treated, the reasonable and feasible measures required to prevent the imminent risk to the individual's life, and the obligation of the authorities to take preventive operational measures. It also mentions the public's right to information and the need for appropriate procedures to identify shortcomings and errors.

"How does the Court determine whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Articles 2 or 3 in the destination country, and what criteria and evidence must be considered in assessing this risk?","The risk assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the applicant ’s removal to the country of destination, in the light of the general situation there and of his or her personal circumstances.
In the context of these procedures, (a) it is for the applicants to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, they would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 186; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130); (b) where such evidence is adduced, it is for the returning State to dispel any doubts raised by it, and to subject the alleged risk to close scrutiny by considering the foreseeable consequences of removal for the individual concerned in the receiving State, in the light of the general situation there and the individual ’s personal circumstances; such an assessment must take into consideration general sources such as reports of the World Health Organisation or of reputable non -governmental organisations and the medical certificates concerning the person in question ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 187; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130); the impact of removal must be assessed by comparing the applicant ’s state of health prior to removal and how it would evolve after transfer to the receiving State (Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 188; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130); (c) the returning State must verify on a case -by-case basis whether the care generally available in the receiving State is sufficient and appropriate in practice for the treatment of the applicant ’s illness so as to prevent him or her being exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3 ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 189; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130); (d) the returning State must also consider the extent to which the applicant would actually have access to the treatment, including with reference to its cost, the existence of a social and family network, and the distance to be travelled in order to have access to the required care ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 190; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130); (e) where, after the relevant information ha s been examined, serious doubts persist regarding the impact of removal on the applicant – on account of the general situation in the receiving country and/or their individual situation – the returning State must obtain individual and sufficient assurances from the receiving State, as a precondition for removal, that appropriate treatment will be available and accessible to the persons concerned so that they do not find themselves in a situation contrary to Article 3 ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, § 191; Savran v. Denmark [GC] , 2021, § 130).
The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one ( F.G. v. Sweden [GC], 2016, §§ 113; Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 109).
It is, in principle , for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3; where such evidence has been adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts raised by it ( Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 109).
A full and ex nunc evaluation is required where it is necessary to take into account information that has come to light after the final decision by the domestic authorities was taken (Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 106; F.G. v. Sweden [GC], 2016, § 115; Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom , 2011, § 215) .
Any finding in such cases regarding the general situation in a given country and its dynamic as well as the finding as to the existence of a particular vulnerable group, is in its very essence a factual ex nunc assessment
There is therefore nothing to preclude such a re -examination of the general situation from being carried out by the Court when dealing with an individual case ( Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 108).
The starting -point for the assessment of a real risk upon removal should be the examination of the general situation in the destination country.
In this connection, and where it is relevant to do so, regard must be had to whether there is a general situation of violence existing in the country of destination ( Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 96; Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom , 2011, § 216).
However, a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion to the country in question, unless the level of intensity of the violence is sufficient to conclude that any removal to that country would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention.
The Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases, where there is a real risk of ill -treatment simply by virtue of the individual concerned being exposed to such violence on returning to the country in question ( Khasanov and Rakhmanov v. Russia [GC], 2022, § 96; Europ ean Court of Human Rights 28/62 Last update: 31.08.2023 Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom , 2011, § 218; the latter case constitutes an example where that threshold was met ).
Indeed, i n cases concerning destinations with difficult security situations, the Court normally also attaches importance to additional individual risk factors (such as membership of a vulnerable group, see, most recently , concerning Syria: M.D. and Others v. Russia , 2021, §§ 104-111; and O.D. v. Bulgaria , 2019, §§ 50-55; contrast with A.A. v. Swe den, 2023, where the Court found that the general situation in the country of destination, Libya, was serious and fragile but was not so extreme as to reach the aforementioned threshold and that there were no additional individual risk factors)
By way of example, in respect of the weight attributed to country material see Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom , 2011, §§ 230-234; in respect of the assessment of an applicant ’s credibility see N. v. Finland , 2005; A.F. v. France , 2015, and M.O. v. Switzerland , 2017; and in respect of the domestic authorities ’ obligation to assess the relevance, authenticity and probative value of documents put forward by an applicant – from the outset or later on – which relate to the core of their protection claims see M.D. and M.A. v. Belgium , 2016; Singh and Others v. Belgium , 2012, and M.A. v. Switzerland , 2014; for a combination of elements leading to the conclusion that the assessment of the individual risk of a journalist was insufficient see S.H. v. Malta , 2022.",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_immigration,"[51, 52, 53, 63, 74, 84]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the Court determines whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Articles 2 or 3 in the destination country. It covers the criteria and evidence that must be considered in assessing this risk, including the need for the applicant to provide evidence, the role of the returning State in dispelling doubts, the assessment of the impact of removal on the individual's health, the availability and accessibility of treatment in the receiving State, and the requirement for individual assurances in cases of serious doubts.

"Based on the case of an individual who survived a potentially lethal attack by non-State actors, what articles of the Convention may apply and under what circumstances?","In such cases, depending on the circumstances, the Court may examine the complaint separately under each provision (see, for example, Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v.

However, in exceptional circumstances, depending on consideratio ns such as the degree and type of force used and the nature of the injuries, use of force by State agents which does not result in death may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, if the behaviour of the State agents, by its very nature, puts the applicant ’s life at serious risk even though the latter survives (Makaratzis v.

"How does the Court determine whether a legislative gap that excludes non-citizens from accessing gender recognition procedures violates their right to respect for their private life under Article 8 of the Convention, considering the factors of public interest, individual circumstances, and the potential risks and inconveniences faced by transgender individuals?","In Rana v. Hungary , (Committee judgment) , 2020, there existed a legislative gap which excluded all lawfully settled non -Hungarian citizens from accessing the procedures for changing gender and name regardless of their circumstances .
As a result, the authorities had rejected the applicant ’s application on purely formal grounds, without examining his situation.
The Court thus found that, by not giving the applicant (an Iranian transgender refugee, who did not have a Hungarian birth certificate) access to the legal gender recognition procedure, a fair balance had not been struck between the public interest and the applicant ’s right to respect for his private life.
There was therefore a violation of Article 8 of the Convention (see also R.K. v. Hungary , 2023, §§ 57-77).
Bearing in mind that the short extract of the birth certificate and the new ID documents indicated only the reassigned gender, and that these documents could be used in nearly all everyday situations, the Court considered that , in his daily life , the applicant was not required to reveal intimate details of his private life and he had not shown that the impugned inconveniences were sufficiently serious.
Given the specific circumstances, the Court found that any potential risk of adverse consequences was not capable of rendering the Polish system deficient from the point of view of the State ’s positive obligation s.
The Court considered that the best interests of the child had to be examined exhaustively in this context , taking into account any conflict of interest between the child and his transgender paren ts.
It was also necessary to take account of the child ’s possible future interests and the interests of children who are in a comparable situation and to whom the legislative provisions in question also appl ied.
Moreover , there had been a limited number of situations that could lead, when presenting a child ’s birth certificate, to the disclosure of the transgender identity of the parents.
In particular, precautions had been in place to reduce the inconvenience to which tra nsgender parents might be exposed (§§ 130-133) .",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[68, 69, 70, 55, 59, 61, 63]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a detailed analysis of the Court's determination regarding a legislative gap that excludes non-citizens from accessing gender recognition procedures. It discusses the specific case of Rana v. Hungary and explains how the Court found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.

What factors does the Court consider when assessing the compatibility of the withdrawal of a settled migrant's right of residence and expulsion order with Article 8 of the Convention?,"Where an applicant ’s criminal culpability was excluded on account of his mental illness when the criminal act was perpetrated, this fact should be adequately taken into account as it might have the effect of limiting the weight to be attached to the “nature and seriousness” of the offence criterion in the overall balancing of interests and, consequently, the extent to which a State could legitimately rely on the applicant ’s criminal acts as the basis for the expulsion and ban on re -entry ( Savran v. Denmark [GC], 2021, §§ 193-194).
Where such right is subsequently withdrawn and the person ’s expulsion is ordered , for instance because the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, the Court has set out the relevant criteria to assess compatibility with Article 8 of the Convention in Üner v. the Netherlands [GC] , 2006, §§ 54-60: the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant; the length of the applicant ’s stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled; the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant ’s conduct during that period; the nationalities of the various persons concerned; the applicant ’s family situation, such as the length of a marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a couple ’s family life; whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship; whether there are children from the marriage and, if so, their age; the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled; the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the difficulties which any children of the applicant are likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled; and the solidity 9
The Court has applied these criteria in numerous cases since Üner v. the Netherlands [GC] , 2006, although the weight to be attached to each criterion will vary according to the specific circumstances of the case ( Maslov v. Austria [GC], 2008, § 70).
Importantly, the fact that the offence committed by an applicant was at the more serious end of the criminal spectrum is not in and of itself determinative of a case; rather, it is just one factor which has to be weighed in the balance, together with the other criteria ( Unuane v. the United Kingdom , 2020, § 87).",5,5,5,4,5,,guide_immigration,"[88, 89, 90, 92, 93]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that the Court considers when assessing the compatibility of the withdrawal of a settled migrant's right of residence and expulsion order with Article 8 of the Convention.

"How does the Court apply Article 8 in cases where individuals are exposed to pollution or other nuisances that affect their quality of life and well-being, even if their health hasn't deteriorated?","The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or mental effects on the applicant ’s health or quality of life (Fadeyeva v. Russia , 2005 , § 69; Borysiewicz v. Poland, 2008, § 51; Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), 2008; Oluić v. Croatia , 2010 , § 49; Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria, 2010 , § 90; Leon and Agnieszka Kania v. Poland, 2009 , § 100; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine , 2011, § 105; Apanasewicz v. Poland, 2011 , § 96; Marchiş and Others v. Romania (dec.), 2011; Gr imkovskaya v. Ukraine , 2011 , § 58; Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 37; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom , 2012, § 188; Martínez Martínez and Pino Manzano v. Spain, 2012 , § 46; Udovičić v. Croatia , 2014 , § 139; Dzemyuk v. Ukraine , 2014 , § 78; Płachta and Others v. Poland (dec.), 2014 , § 80; Fieroiu and Others v. Romania (dec.), 2017 , § 19; Jugheli and Others v. Georgia , 2017, § 62; Calancea and Others Guide on case -law of the Convention – Environment European Court of Human Rights 27/94 Updated : 31.08. 2023 v. Moldova (dec.), 2018, § 27; Kožul and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina , 2019, § 34; Cordella and Others v. Italy , 2019 , § 157; Çiçek and Others v. Turkey (dec.), 2020 , § 22; Yevgeniy Dmitriyev v. Russia , 2020, § 32; Solyanik v. Russia , 2022, § 40; Pavlov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 61; Kotov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 101).
Depending on the circumstances , the severity threshold may be reached even where the pollution or noise complained of it is only occasional (see Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 38, concerning noise from fireworks let off only during two separate weeks annually ).
A person ’s health does not necessarily have to be affected, or even threatened, for an issue to arise under Article 8 on the grounds of his or her exposure to pollution or other nuisance (Lόpez Ostra v. Spain, 1994, § 51; see also : Sciavilla v. Italy (dec.), 2000; Botti v. Italy (dec.), 2004; Kyrtatos v. Greece , 2003 , § 52; Taşkın and Others v. Turkey , 2004 , § 113; Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), 2008; Furlepa v. Poland (dec.), 2008; Greenpeace E.V. and Others v. Germany (dec.), 2009; Marchiş and Others v. Romania (dec.), 2011; Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 36; Dzemyuk v. Ukraine , 2014 , § 88; Jugheli and Others v. Georgia, 2017 , § 62; Yevgeniy Dmitriyev v. Russia , 2020, § 32; Solyanik v. Russia , 2022, § 41; Pavlov and Others v. Russia, 2022, § 69; Kotov and Others v. Russia, 2022, § 108).
The Court pointed out that the fact that the applic ant’s state of health had not deteriorated was insufficient to rule out the applicability of Article 8 .
It deduced the provision ’s applicability from the fact that the impugned nuisance had affected his quality of life and his well- being.
Similarly , in Di Sarno and Others v. Italy , 2012 , § 108, the Court noted that the applicants, who had been forced to live in an environment pollute d by refuse left in the streets for several months, had not alleged that they had fallen ill, and that there was no evidence that their lives and health had been in danger.
did, however, consider that this situation could have led to a deterioration of the applicants ’ quality of life and, in particular, have adversely affected their right to respect for their homes and their family life , and emphasised that “Article 8 may be relied on even in the absence of any evidence of a serious danger to people ’s health”.
The exposure of a person to an environmental hazard as opposed to pollution or nuisance whose effects he or she experiences direct ly may be sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8.
The environmental hazard in question must be such as to impinge significantly on the person ’s ability to enjoy his home or private or family life ( McGinley and Egan v. United Kingdom , 1998, §§ 96-97; Roche v. United Kingdom [GC], 2005 , § 155-156; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine , 2011, §§ 105 and 111; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom , 2012, § 192; Dzemyuk v.

"What are the conditions that the Court sets forth to analyze the legality of domestic measures and restrictions, and how do these conditions apply to cases where police apply force against peaceful participants during the dispersal of an assembly or for maintaining public order, resulting in the interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly?","Police applying force against peaceful participants during the dispersal of an assembly or for maintaining public order constitutes an interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly ( Laguna Guzman v. Spain , 2020, § 42; Zakharov and Varzhabetyan v. Russia , 2020, § 88).
The term “restrictions” in paragraph 2 of Article 11 includes measures such as punitive measure taken after an assembly ( Ezelin v. France , 1991, § 39).
The Court has found that if there is a clear and acknowledged link between the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly by the applicants and the measures taken against them, their arrest, detention and the ensuing administrative charges will constitute an interference with their right guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention ( Navalnyy and Yashin v. Russia , 2014, § 52; see also Ekrem Can and Others v. Turkey , 2022, § 86).
In Frumkin v. Russia , 2016, § 138, the Court found that the guarantees of Article 11 continued to apply in respect of the applicant even after the assembly was officially terminated, notwithstanding some clashes the participants had with the State agents.
Thus, any measures taken against the applicant – in this case his arrest after the time slot originally authorised for the assembly – had to comply with the requirements of Article 11 (see also Varoğlu Atik and Others v.

"In the case of an applicant committing a serious criminal offense, how does the Court determine the weight to be attached to the ""nature and seriousness"" of the offense in relation to the applicant's mental illness at the time of the offense?","The removal of a person suffering from serious illness may also breach Article 8 ( Paposhvili v. Belgium [GC], 2016, §§ 221-226) and a person ’s mental illness has to be adequately taken into account when examining the proportionality of his or her expulsion in view of a criminal offence he or she has committed ( Savran v.

What criteria does the Court use to determine whether there has been interference with a prisoner's right to respect for correspondence with the Convention institutions under Article 8?,"A prisoner ’s correspondence with the Convention institutions falls within the scope of Article 8.
The Court has found that there was interference with the right to respect for correspondence where letters sent to prisoners by the Convention institutions had been opened ( Peers v. Greece , 2001, § 81; Valašinas v. Lithuania , 2001, §§ 128-129; Idalov v. Russia [GC], 2012, §§ 197-201).
As in other cases, such interference will breach Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursued one of the legitimate aims set forth in Article 8 § 2 and was “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve that aim ( Petra v. Romania , 1998, § 36).
In a specific case where only one of a significant number of letters had been “opened by mistake” at a facility to which the applicant had just been transferred, the Court found that there was no evidence of any deliberate intention on the authorities ’ part to undermine respect for the applicant ’s correspondence with the Convention institutions such as to constitute interference with his right to respect for his correspondence within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 (Touroude v. France (dec.) , 2000 ; Sayoud v. France (dec.) , 2007 ).
On the other hand, where monitoring of correspondence is automatic, unconditional, independent of any decision by a judicial authority and unappealable, it is not “in accordance with the law” ( Petra v. Romania , 1998, § 37; Kornakovs v. Latvia , 2006, § 159).
Some measure of control over prisoners ’ correspondence is acceptable and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention, regard being paid to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment ( Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom , 1983, § 98; Golder v. the United Kingdom , 1975, § 45).
However, such control must not exceed what is required by the legitimate aim pursued in accordance with Article 8 § 2 of the C onvention.
While it may be necessary to monitor detainees ’ contact with the outside world, including telephone contact, the rules applied must afford the prisoner appropriate protection against arbitrary interference by the national authorities ( Doerga v. the Netherlands , 2004, § 53).
Examples of “interference” within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 include: ▪ interception by the prison authorities of a letter ( McCallum v. the United Kingdom , 1990, § 31) o r failure to post a letter ( William Faulkner v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 11; Mehmet Nuri Özen and Others v. Turkey , 2011, § 42); ▪ restrictions on ( Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom , § 110) or the destruction of mail (Fazıl Ahmet Tamer v. Turkey , 2006, §§ 52 and 54 for a filtering system); ▪ opening of a letter ( Narinen v. Finland , 2004, § 32) – including where there are operational defects within the prison mail service ( Demirtepe v. France , 1999, § 26) or the mail is simply opened before being handed over straight away ( Faulkner v. the United Kingdom (dec.) , 2002 ); ▪ delays in delivering mail ( Cotleţ v. Romania , 2003, § 34) or a refusal to forward emails sent to the prison ’s address to a particular prisoner ( Helander v. Finland (dec.), 2013, § 48); and ▪ scanning and uploading of prisoners ’ private correspondence, both incoming and outgoing, onto the National Judicial Network Server, even where the authori ties have not accessed it directly ( Nuh Uzun and Others v. Turkey , 2022, §§ 80-82); 90
Interference with a prisoner ’s right to respect for his or her correspondence must also be necessary in a democratic society ( Yefimenko v. Russia , 2013, § 142).
Such “ necessity” must be assessed with regard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment.
The “prevention of disorder or crime” ( Kwiek v. Poland , 2006, § 47; Jankauskas v. Lithuania , 2005, § 21), in particular, may justify more extensive interference in the case of a prisoner than for a person at liberty.
In any event, the measure in question must be proportionate within the meaning of Article 8 § 2.
The extent of the monitoring and the existence of adequate safeguards against abuse are fundamental criteria in this assessment ( Tsonyo Tsonev v. Bulgaria , 2009, § 42).
In this case, the Court found that national law which allowed for automatic censorship of prisoners ’ correspondence, without drawing any distinction between different categories such as correspondence with the Ombudsman, violated Article 8 (§ 81).
Sim ilarly, the indiscriminate, routine checking of all of the applicant ’s correspondence , including letters to State authorities and non -governmental organisations, constitute d a violation of Article 8 ( Jankauskas v.

"How does the Court determine the application of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a case involving the extension of an operating license for a nuclear power station, and what factors did the Court consider to differentiate between the legal doctrine and its contextual application in this case?","In the case of Balmer -Schafroth and Others v. Switzerland, 1997, §§ 39-40, the Court ruled that the connection between the Federal Council ’s decision to extend the operating licence of a nuclear power station and the right of the applicants, who lived near the power station, to protection of their physical integrity had been too tenuous and remote for Article 6 § 1 to apply .
It observed in that context that the applic ants had failed to demonstrate that the operation of the power station had exposed them personally to a danger that was not only serious but also specific and, above all, imminent .
The Court made a similar finding in Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland [GC] , 2000, §§ 49-55.
It further noted that the applicants were unduly seeking to derive from Article 6 § 1 of the Convention a remedy to contest the very principle of the use of nuclear energy, or at least a means for transferring from the Government to the courts the responsibility for taking, on the basis of the technical evidence, the ultimate decision on the operation of individual nuclear power stations .
The Court stressed that best way to regulate the use of nuclear power wa s for each Contracting State to take a policy decision according to its own democratic processes ( see also : Folkman and Others v. Czech Republic (dec.), 2006; Sdružení Jihočeské Matky v. Czech Republic (dec.), 2006).
It noted that the outcome of the proceedings had not been direct ly decisive for the applicant ’s rights, pointing out that there had been no pecuniary interest at stake in the proceedings and that the applicant had never asserted before the domestic courts that the impugned development had had a negative effect on the value of his property .",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_environment,"[47, 48, 49, 39, 42, 53, 73]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the Court's determination of the application of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a case involving the extension of an operating license for a nuclear power station.

"In cases where false or incomplete personal information is collected and retained by the authorities, and such data interferes with an individual's right to respect for private life under Article 8, what criteria does the Court apply to determine whether there has been an interference with the right and whether the interference is in accordance with the law, pursues a legitimate aim, and is necessary in a democratic society?","The existence of guarantees against arbitrariness and the ability to have the measure in question scrutinised by an independent and impartial body competent to review all the relevant questions of fact and law, in order to determine the lawfulness of the measure and censure a possible abuse by the authorities, are essential ( ibid. , referring to Leander v. Sweden , 1987, § 66).
False or incomplete personal information collected and retained by the authorities may make everyday life difficult for the data subject ( Khelili v. Switzerland, 2011, § 64), prove defamatory ( Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000, § 44) or remove a number of substantial procedural safeguards provided by law to protect the rights of data subjects ( Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey , 2008, § § 35, 40 -42).
In these cases, the examination of the legitimate aims which may justify interference with the exercise of the Article 8 rights, as listed in paragraph 2, is rather succinct.
These aims are the protection of national security, public safety and the economic well -being of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
The Court generally confirms the existence of one or more of these legitimate aims invoked by the Government.
In order to be necessary in a democratic society , any measure interfering with the protection of personal data under Article 8 must meet a “pressing social need” and must not be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (Z v. Finland, 1997, § 94; Khelili v. Switzer land, 2011, § 62; Vicent Del Campo v. Spain, 2018, § 46).
The reasons invoked by the Government must be pertinent and sufficient (Z v. Finland, 1997, § 94).
While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment in all these respects, the final evaluation of whether the interference is necessary remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 101).
False or incomplete personal information collected and retained by the authorities may make the data subject ’s daily life more difficult (Khelili v. Switzerland, 2011, § 64), may prove defamatory (Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000, § 44) or may remove certain statutory procedural safeguards to protect the data subject ’s rights when such data can be transmitted between various authorities (Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey , 2008, § § 42-43).
The storing by a public authority of information relating to an individual’s private life, however that information is obtained, amounts to an interference with the right to respect for the data subject ’s private life within the meaning of Article 8, whether or not the data is subsequently used (Amman v. Switzerland [GC], 2000, § 69; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000, § 46; S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 67; M.K. v. France , 2013, § 29; Aycaguer v.

How does the Court justify that the inability of an individual to secure rectification of their personal data in official records amounts to interference with their right to respect for private life under Article 8?,"The inability of an individual to secure rectification of a report referring to him in the Schengen database ( Dalea v. France (dec.), 2010) and the registration of a person ’s ethnic origin in official records ( Ciubotaru v. Moldova , 2010, § 59) amount to interference with their right to respect for private life.
The existence of guarantees against arbitrariness and the ability to have the measure in question scrutinised by an independent and impartial body competent to review all the relevant questions of fact and law, in order to determine the lawfulness of the measure and censure a possible abuse by the authorities, are essential ( ibid. , referring to Leander v.

False or incomplete personal information collected and retained by the authorities may make everyday life difficult for the data subject ( Khelili v.

Romania [GC], 2000, § 44) or remove a number of substantial procedural safeguards provided by law to protect the rights of data subjects ( Cemalettin Canlı v. Turkey , 2008, § § 35, 40 -42).
The fact of imposing on an individual requesting rectification of his personal data in the official State registers a requirement which creates insurmountable barriers for him may prove incompatible with the State’ s obligation to guarantee effective respect for his private life ( Ciubotaru v. Moldova , 2010, § § 51-59).
In a case concerning the applicant ’s inability to obtain the modification of the registration of his ethnic origin in the official registers, the requirement on proving that his parents had belonged to a specific ethnic group had created insurmountable barriers for the data subject in recording an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his parents b y the authorities (ibid. , § 57).
The storing by a public authority of information relating to an individual’s private life, however that information is obtained, amounts to an interference with the right to respect for the data subject ’s private life within the meaning of Article 8, whether or not the data is subsequently used (Amman v. Switzerland [GC], 2000, § 69; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000, § 46; S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 67; M.K. v. France , 2013, § 29; Aycaguer v. France , 2017 § 33).
The intrinsically private character of this information calls for the Court to exercise careful scrutiny of any State measure authorising its retention and use by the authorities without the consent of the person concerned ( S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC] , 2008, § 104).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_data_protection,"[287, 288, 289, 11, 39, 126, 201]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the inability to rectify personal data in official records can amount to interference with the right to respect for private life under Article 8.

"How does the Court distinguish between lawful security operations and large-scale anti-terrorist operations in relation to the use of lethal force, and what criteria does it establish for the application of the principle of absolute necessity under Article 2 of the Convention?","The Court , distinguishing between “routine police operations” and situations of large -scale anti- terrorist operations, held that, in the latter case, often in situations of acute crisis requiring “tailor- made” responses, States should be able to rely on solutions that would be appropriate to the circumstances.
That being said, it has also underlined that, in a lawful security operation which is aimed, in the first place, at protecting the lives of people who find themselves in d anger of unlawful violence from third parties, the use of lethal force remains governed by the strict rules of “absolute necessity” within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention.
Thus, i t is of primary importance that the domestic regulations be guided by the same principle and contain clear indications to that extent, including the obligations to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm and exclude the use of weapons and ammunition that carry unwarranted consequences ( Tagayeva and Others v. Russia , 2017, § 595).
As a rule , the use of the term “absolutely necessary” in Article 2 § 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraph 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention.
That being said , the Court has underlined that it is acutely conscious of the difficulties faced by modern States in the fight against terrorism and the dangers of hindsight analysis.
In this connection, it has underlined the need to differentiate between the political choices made in the course of fighting terrorism, that remain by their nature outside of such supervision, and other, more operational aspects of the authorities ’ actions that have a direct bearing on the protect ed rights.
Therefore, the absolute necessity test formulated in Article 2 is bound to be applied with different degrees of scrutiny, depending on whether and to what extent the authorities were in control of the situation and other relevant constraints inherent in operative decision -making in this sensitive sphere (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia , 2017, § 481).
In determining whether the force used is compatible with Article 2, it may therefore be relevant whether a law enforcement operation has been planned and controlled so as to minimise to the greatest extent possible recourse to lethal force or incidental loss of life ( Bubbins v. the United Kingdom , 2005, § 136; Huohvanainen v. Finland, 2007, § 94).
By contrast, the Court held that the use of force was strictly proportionate in the pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention in:  Bubbins v. the United Kingdom , 2005, § 141, where the applicant ’s brother was shot by police officers in his flat following a two -hour siege; see also Huohvanainen v. Finland, 2007, § 107;  Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 194, which concerned the fatal shooting of a demonstrator by a member of the security forces at a G8 s ummit;  Perk and Others v. Turkey , 2006, § 73, which concerned the killing of the applicants ’ relatives during a police operation against a radical armed movement (see also Yüksel Erdoğan and Others v.

"In the context of a series of similar cases brought by different applicants, or a sequence of identical measures directed against the same applicant, how does the Court assess whether these instances amount to a pattern of misuse of power targeting specific groups or individuals, and how does this assessment relate to the application of Article 18 of the Convention?","Faced with a series of similar cases brought by different applicants, or a sequence of identical measures directed against the same applicant, the Court will assess whether such instances, viewed as a whole, amount to a pattern of misuse of power targeting specific groups or individuals ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 167-170; and Aliyev v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 223).
Where this is the case, the Court will consider whether any subsequent well -founded allegations of ulterior purposes against the impugned State belong to the established pattern ( Navalnyy v. Russia (no. 2) , 2019, § 94; Natig Jafarov v. Azerbaijan , 2019, § § 64-65; Ibrahimov and Mammadov v. Azerbaijan , 2020, §§151 -152; Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan (no. 2) , 2020, § § 113-114; and Yunusova and Yunusov v. Azerbaijan (no. 2) , 2020, § 187-188; Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 76).
Where a certain pattern of misuse of power by the respondent State was established , this factor is relevant for the purposes of ascertaining the existence of an ulterior purpose in a given case (Democracy and Human Rights Resource Centre and Mustafayev v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 109) .
It also Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights can, in the context of a plurality of purposes, point to a predominance of the ulterior purpose pursued by the authorities of th e State concerned (Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 77).
Thus, before embarking on the analysis of a complaint under Article 18, the Court will first ascertain whether the crux of it has been already examined under the relevant substantive provision ( Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 204; Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia (no. 2) , 2020, § 622; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 401; Democracy and Human Rights Resource Centre and Mustafayev v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 103; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 317).
Where this has been the case, the Court will generally consider that the complaint under Article 18 does not raise any separate issue ( Navalnyy and Gunko v. Russia , 2020 , §§ 96-98; Staykov v. Bulgaria , 2021 , §§ 120-121).
Even where a clear pattern misuse of power by the respondent State, in breach of Article 18, is established, this does not dispense the Court from examining whether an applicant ’s particular conduct amounts to an abuse of rights within the meaning of Article 17 of the Convention ( Yuksekdag Senoglu and Others v. Türkiye , 2022, § § 487-488 and 638 -640).",5,5,5,5,3,,guide_art_18,"[54, 55, 56, 28, 57, 58, 102]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court assesses whether a series of similar cases or identical measures amount to a pattern of misuse of power targeting specific groups or individuals.

"In the case of Schlumpf v. Switzerland, what were the specific circumstances that led the Court to find a violation of Article 8?","In Schlumpf v. Switzerland , 2009 , the Court held that , while the Convention did not guarantee any right to the reimbursement of medical costs incurred for a sex change and nobody had prevented the applicant from having a surgical operation, the two -year wait applied by the insurance company contrary to the clear views of the specialists was, in the light notably of the applicant ’s relatively advanced age, liable to influence her decision whether to have the operation.
When called upon to decide the applicant ’s claim for the reimbursement of the costs of her sex -change operation, the domestic court had relied on the two - year criterion which it had established in its own case -law, without any statutory basis .
When insisting on compliance with this criterion , the domestic court had refused to carry out an analysis of the specific circumstances of the applicant ’s case or to weigh up the various competing interests and they had failed to take into account the medical advances that had been made in the area .
In view of the applicant ’s very particular situation – she had been over 67 years – and the respondent State ’s limited margin of appreciation, the Court concluded that a fair balance had not been struck between the interests of the insurance company and those of the applicant.
The Court also found that by refusing to allow the applicant to adduce expert evidence, on the basis of an abstract rule , the domestic court had substituted its own view for that of the doctors and psychiatrists.
Consequently, the applicant had not had a fair hearing.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[72, 73, 74, 27, 88, 94, 159]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the specific circumstances that led the Court to find a violation of Article 8 in the case of Schlumpf v.

How does the Court differentiate between hate speech falling within the scope of Article 17 and hate speech falling within the scope of Article 10?,"The first is to find that the ‘hate speech ’ in question falls within the scope of Article 17 and is thus excluded entirely from the protection of Article 10 of the Convention17.
The first application of this approach in the context of homophobic speech was in Lenis v. Greece (dec.), 2023, concerning the conviction of a senior Greek Orthodox Church official for an article published on his personal blog.
The Court considered that on account of their content, tone and context, the expressions used in the disputed article constitute d hate speech and incitement to violence against a group of people on the basis of their sexual orientation.
Three additional factors reinforced that conclusion: in the first place , the applicant in his position as a senior Church official had the power to influence many people; second ly, the views expressed in the article were disseminated to a wide audience through the Internet; and third ly, the protection of the dignity and human value of persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation , was of high importance in modern European society .
Consequently, the Court applied Article 17 to find that the applicant could not claim the benefit of the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention (§§ 46-57).
The second is to find that the ‘hate speech ’ falls within the scope of Article 10 and is subjected to the usual tests thereunder (Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden , 2012, §§ 47-60; Beiza ras and Levickas v. Lithuania , 2020 , § 125; Lilliendahl v. Iceland (dec .), 2020 , § 39).
The Court has applied the second approach not only to speech which explicitly calls for violence or other criminal acts but also to attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population (see , always in the context of this Guide , Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania , 2020 , § 125; Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden , 2012 , § 55)
In Mladina d.d. Ljubljana v. Slovenia , 2014, §§ 37-49 the applicant company complained under Article 10 about the fact that it had been ordered to pay damages for an article harshly critical of the remarks of a parliamentary deputy (S.P.)and of his conduct during a parliamentary debate on the legal regulation of same -sex relationships.
The Court held that while the terminology of the article was extreme it was a value judgment which had a sufficient factual basis.
Lastly, the article matched not only SP ’s provocative comments, but also the style in which he had expressed them.
Viewed in the light of the context in which the impugned statement was made, and the style used in the article, the Court considered that it had not amounted to a 15
Therefore, the domestic courts had not convincingly established any pressing social need for placing the protection of S.P. ’s reputation above the applicant company ’s right to freedom o f expression.
There had therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention .",5,5,5,4,4,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[96, 97, 98, 91, 94, 155]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court differentiates between hate speech falling within the scope of Article 17 and hate speech falling within the scope of Article 10.

"In the context of same-sex marriage, under what circumstances does the Court find that the State has failed to strike a fair balance and provide protection to same-sex unions, while at the same time respecting the margin of appreciation of the State?","Despite the gradual evolution of States on the matter, neither Article 12 alone, no r Article 12 in conjunction with Article 14 impose an obligation to grant a same -sex couple access to marriage ( ibid. , §§ 37-38; Oliari and Others v. Italy , 2015 , §§ 192-194).
Conversely, while in Schalk and Kopf v. Austria , 2010 , §§ 61 and 63 , the Court found under Article 12 that it would no longer consider that the right to marry must in all circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the opposite sex, it however considered that Article 12 does not impose an obligation on Cont racting States to grant same -sex couples access to marriage.
T he same can be said of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 12 ( Oliari and Others v. Italy , 2015 , 193).
Since , until 201 6, the Italian authorities had failed to recognise that situation ( i.e. the marriage contracted abroad) or provide any form of protection to the applicants ’ union, the State had failed to strike a fair balance between any competing interests.
In particular, they had fai led to ensure that the applicants had available a specific legal framework providing for the recognition and protection of their same -sex unions , in violation of Article 8 of the Convention .
In assessing the situation in Italy, the Court held that there was a positive obligation to ensure that the applicants, same -sex couple s in stable unions, or same - sex couples married in a foreign State, have available a specific legal framework providing for the recognition and protection of their same -sex unions ( Oliari and Others v. Italy , 2015, § 185; Orlandi and Others v. Italy , 2017, § 210).
However, States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation as regards the exact status conferred by alternative means of recognition and the rights and obligations conferred by such a union or registered partnership ( Schalk and Kopf v. Austria , 2010 , §§ 108-09; Oliari and Others v. Italy , 2015, § 177; Gas and Dubois v. France , 2012 , § 66).
The Court has already held, in respect of various domestic legislations, that civil unions provide an opportunity to obtain a legal status equal or similar to marriage in many respects ( Schalk and Kopf v. Austria , 2010 , § 109, concerning Austria, Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014 , § 83, in connection with the Finnish system ; Chapin and Charpentier v. France , 2016 , §§ 49 and 51, concerning France ; Orlandi and Others v.

Nevertheless, in Fedotova and Others v.

The Court also found that the respondent State had not exceeded its margin of appreciation in its choice 22
In Chapin and Charpentier v. France , 2016 , the Court found no violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, as the applicants (a same -sex couple who complained that they had no access to marriage) had an opportunity to obtain a legal status equal or similar to marriage in many respects via the pacte civil de solidarit é.

"In the case of Handzhiyski v.

What factors did the Court consider in determining whether sanctions were necessary in relation to acts that do not damage the monument but are capable of profaning it?","For instance, acts intended to criticise the government or its policies, or to call attention to the suffering of a disadvantaged group cannot be equated to acts calculated to offend the memory of the victims of a mass atr ocity.
The social significance of the monument in question, the values or ideas which it symbolises, and the degree of veneration that it enjoys in the respective community are also important considerations.
However, when it comes to acts – which, though capable of profaning a monument, do not damage the monument – the question whether it can be “necessary in a democratic society” to impose sanctions in relation to them becomes more nuanced.

"In the case of the death of a child during a fight in class while the teacher was absent, based on Article 2 (Right to Life), what criteria does the Court use to determine if the authorities were obliged to take preventive operational measures to protect the child?","If the Court considers that it has not been established that the authorities knew or ought to have know n at the relevant time of the existence of a risk which was both real and immediate, no obligation would be triggered to take preventive operation al measures in that regard ( Kurt v. Austria [GC], 2021, § 211; see also Derenik Mkrtchyan and Gayane Mkrtchyan v. Armenia , 2021, §§ 59-60, which concerned the death of a child of ten years with pre -existing health issues, during a fight with his peers in class while the teacher was absent ; Tagiyeva v.

The Court has considered the State to have an obligation to take preventive operational measures to protect one or more individuals identifiable in advance as the potential target of a lethal act in contexts such as:  murder of a prisoner ( Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom , 2002, §57);  domestic violence ( Branko Tomaši ć and Others v.

"In a case where a detainee with psychological difficulties fails in his attempts to commit suicide, how does the Court determine the applicability of Article 2 of the Convention?","In Jeanty v. Belgium , 2020, where a detainee with psychological difficulties failed in his numerous attempts to commit suicide, the Court considered that Article 2 was applicable in the circumstances of the case, irrespective of the fact that the injuries he had sustained were not serious, in view of the nature of the action at issue which put the applicant ’s life at a real and imminent risk ( § 62).
In fact, the Court has recently underlined that Article 2 also comes into play in situations where the person concerned was the victim of an activity or conduct, whether public or private, which by its nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and he or she has suffered injuries that appear life - threatening as they occur, even though he or she ultimately survived ( Tërshana v. Albania, 2020, § 132; Lapshin v. Azerbaijan, 2021, § 71).
Article 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction ( Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], 2014, § 130).
In particular, the Court has held that in exceptional circumstances, depending on considerations such as the degree and type of force used and the nature of the injuries, use of force by State agents which does not result in death may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, if the behaviour of the State agents, by its very nature, puts the applicant ’s life at serio us risk even though the latter survives ( Makaratzis v. Greece [GC] , 2004, § 55; Soare and Others v. Romania, 2011, §§ 108-109; Trévalec v.

"Based on the facts provided in Boukrourou and Others v. France, where the applicants' mentally disabled relative died during a police operation from heart failure, what criteria did the Court use to determine whether the State protected the right to life and provided requisite medical assistance?","In a number of cases where death was hastened by the use of specific arrest techniques which were not lethal by themselves, the Court examined whether there was a causal link between the force used and the death of the individual and whether State agents protected the right to life by providing that individual with requisite medical assistance ( Scavuzzo -Hager and Others v. Switzerland, 2006, § 55, which concerned the arrest by police officers of a very agitated drug addict who subsequently died; see also Saoud v. France , 2007, which concerned the death by gradual asphyxia of a young man who was han dcuffed and held face down on the ground by police officers for over thirty minutes ; Boukrourou and Others v. France , 2017, where the applicants ’ relative, a mentally disabled person, died during a police operation from heart failure , Kutsarovi v. Bulgaria, 2022, where the applicant ’s son died from a cardiac arrest during his police transfer while in the vehicle and Semache v. France , 2018, which concerned the death of an elderly drunk driver who was immobilised by being bound over with his head touching his knees (“double seated embrace” ).
Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.
Consequently, when an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused.
The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual in custody is particularly stringent where that individual dies ( Salman v. Turkey [GC] , 2000, § 99; Tanlı v. Turkey , 2001, § 141; Tekın and Arslan v. Belgium , 2017, § 83).
The Court was not convinced by the respondent State ’s explanations regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of the applicants in the following cases:  Anguelova v. Bulgaria, 2002, § 121, where the applicant ’s relative died from a skull injury a couple of hours after being detained ;  Kişmir v. Turkey , 2005, § 105, which concerned the death of the applicant ’s son in Diyarbakir police headquarters from respiratory failure related to lung oedema;  Aktaş v. Turkey , 2003, § 294, where the applicants ’ relative died from mechanical asphyxia sustained during custody;
Since the State has direct responsibility for the welfare of persons deprived of their liberty, where such a person dies as a result of a health problem, the State must offer an explanation as to the cause of death and the treatment administered to the person concerned prior to their death ( Slimani v. France , 2004, § 27; Kats and Others v. Ukraine , 2008, § 104).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_2,"[120, 121, 122, 59, 76, 224]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the criteria used by the Court to determine whether the State protected the right to life and provided requisite medical assistance in cases involving the death of individuals during police operations.

"In the context of Article 2 of the Convention, what are the conditions that must be fulfilled for the Court to find a violation when a person claims that their life is at risk?","The principle is th at in such situations Article 2 applies either if (a) the activity at issue was dangerous by its very nature and put the life of the people concerned at real and imminent risk , or if (b) the injur ies suffered by them were seriously life-threatening .
The assessment of the relevant risk or injury depends on various factors ( Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase v. Romania [GC] , 2019, §§ 139-145).
The Court has emphasised on many occasions that Article 2 of the Convention may come into play even if a person whose right to life was allegedly breached did not die.
In particular, the Court has held that in exceptional circumstances, depending on considerations such as the degree and type of force used and the nature of the injuries, use of force by State agents which does not result in death may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, if the behaviour of the State agents, by its very nature, puts the applicant ’s life at serio us risk even though the latter survives ( Makaratzis v. Greece [GC] , 2004, § 55; Soare and Others v. Romania, 2011, §§ 108-109; Trévalec v. Belgium , 2011, §§ 55- 61).
In cases concerning applicants who survived a potentially lethal attack by non -State actors, the Court has adopted a similar approach to the one taken in respect of cases concerning use of force by State agents ( Yotova v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 69).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_2,"[6, 7, 8, 4, 9, 17]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the conditions that must be fulfilled for the Court to find a violation under Article 2 of the Convention when a person claims that their life is at risk.

"In the context of life-sentenced prisoners, what are the criteria that must be considered in a review of their sentence?","It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological ground s.
A review limited to compassionate grounds is therefore insufficient (Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2017 , § 43).
The criteria and conditions laid down in domestic law that pertain to the review must have a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty, and also reflect the relevant case -law of the Court.
This means that prisoners who receive a whole life sentence are entitled to know from the outset what they must do in order to be considered for release and under what conditions.
In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty -five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter ( ibid., §§ 68, 118, 119 and 120).
It is therefore for each State to determine whether the review of sentence is conducted by the executive or the judiciary (Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2017 , § 44).
The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner.
These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation.
The importance of the ground of rehabilitation , that is, the reintegration into society of a convicted person, is underlined, since it is here that the emphasis of European penal policy now lies, as reflected in the practice of the Contracting States, in the relevant standards adopted by the Council of Europe, and in the relevant international materials (Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], 2016 , § 102; and Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2017 , § 42).",5,5,5,5,3,,guide_art_3,"[79, 80, 81, 78, 83]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the criteria that must be considered in a review of the sentence for life-sentenced prisoners.

"Under Article 5 of the ECHR, what are the conditions that the Court sets forth for the legality of domestic measures and restrictions in cases involving the involuntary placement of individuals in psychiatric facilities?","The proceedings leading to the involuntary placement of an individual in a psychiatric facility must thus provide effective guarantees against arbitrariness given the vulnerability of individuals suffering from mental disorders and the need to adduce very w eighty reasons to justify any restriction of their rights ( M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2) , 2015, § 147).
It is essential that the person concerned should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, thro ugh some form of representation.
This implies that an individual confined in a psychiatric institution should, unless there are special circumstances, receive legal assistance in the proceedings relating to the continuation, suspension or termination of his confinement (ibid. , §§ 152 and 153; N. v. Romania , 2017, § 196).
The mere appointment of a lawyer, without that lawyer actually providing legal assistance in the proceedings, could not satisfy the requirem ents of necessary “legal assistance” for persons confined as being of “unsound mind”.
An effective legal representation of persons with disabilities requires an enhanced duty of supervision of their legal representatives by the competent domestic courts ( M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2) , 2015, § 154; see also V.K. v. Russia , 2017, concerning a failure of a court -appointed lawyer to provide effective legal assistance and a manifest failure of the domestic courts to take that defect into consideration ).
Article 5 § 1 (a) applies where persons of unsound mind are detained in psychiatric facilities after conviction ( Klinkenbuß v. Germany , 2016, § 49; Radu v. Germany , 2013, § 97; X v. the United Kingdom , 1981, § 39).
However, it will not apply to such cases following an acquittal ( Luberti v. Italy , 1984, § 25).
As to the second of the above conditions, the detention of a mentally disordered person may be necessary not only where the person needs therapy, medication or other clinical treatment to cure or alleviate his condition, but also where the person needs control and supervision to prevent him, for example, causing harm to himself or other persons ( Ilnseher v. Germany [GC], 2018, § 133; Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom , 2003, § 52).
Article 5 § 1 (e) authorises the confinement of a mentally disordered person even where no medical treatment is envisaged , but such a measure must be duly justified by the seriousness of the person ’s state of health and the need to protect the person concerned or others (N. v. Romania , 2017, § 151).
Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention also affords procedural safeguards related to the judicial decisions authorising a person ’s involuntary hospitalisation ( M.S. v. Croatia (no. 2) , 2015, § 114).
The notion of “lawfulness” requires a fair and proper procedure offering the person concerned sufficient protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty ( V.K. v. Russia , 2017, § 33; X. v. Finland , 2012, § 148, concerning the lack of adequate safeguards in respect of the continuation of the applicant ’s involuntary confinement .
The criteria for “lawful detention” under Article 5 § 1 (e) entail that the review of lawfulness guaranteed by Article 5 § 4 in relation to the continuing detention of a mental health patient should be made by reference to the patient ’s contemporaneous state of health, including his or her dangerousness, as evidenced by up -to-date medical assessments, and not by reference to past events at the origin of the initial decision to detain ( Juncal v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2013, § 30; Ruiz Rivera v.

"In a case where crew members are detained based on diplomatic notes that do not specifically refer to their potential arrest and detention, how does the Court analyze the legality of the detention under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention?","Provisions which are interpreted in an inconsistent and mutually exclusive manner by the domestic authorities will, too, fall short of the “quality of law” standard required under the Convention (Nasrulloyev v. Russia , 2007, § 77; Ječius v. Lithuania , 2000, §§ 53-59).

Although diplomatic notes are a source of international law, detention of crew on the basis of such notes is not lawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention insofar as they are not sufficiently precise and fore seeable.

"Did the ill-treatment experienced by the victim reach the minimum level of severity under Article 3 of the Convention, considering the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects, and the vulnerable situation of the victim, as well as any relevant purposes, intentions, or context?","According to Court ’s well -established case -law, in general, ill- treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.

In order to determine whether the threshold of severity has been reached, other factors may be taken into consideration, in particular: (a) the purpose for which the ill -treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Conv ention; (b) the context in which the ill -treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions ; and (c) whether the victim is in a vulnerable situation ( Khlaifia and Others v.

It will give weight to the following considerations: in the first place, whether the authorities attached the utmost importance to their actions targeting a specific individual or a group; and whether a given case belongs to an established pattern of misuse of power by the respondent State ( Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § § 76-77).
The Court will have regard to the nature and degree of reprehensibility of the alleged ulterior purpose, and bear in mind that the Convention was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society governed by the r ule of law ( Merabishvili v.

"In cases where a contributor to records related to one's private and family life is not available or refuses consent, how does the Court ensure that the interests of the individual seeking access are secured under Article 8 of the Convention?","Such a system is only in conformity with the principle of proportionality if it provides that an independent authority finally decides whether access has to be granted in cases where a contributor fails to answer or withholds consent ( Gaskin v. the United Kingdom , 1989, § 49; M.G. v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 27).

"In the context of searches and seizures of data, under what circumstances would the failure to observe relevant procedural safeguards violate Article 8 of the Convention?","Failure to observe the relevant procedural safeguards when conducting searches and seizures of data entails a violation of Article 8 (Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v. Austria , 2007, §§ 66-68; contrast Tamosius v. the United Kingdom (dec.) , 2002 ).
For example, t he Court has criticised the following: ▪ a search warrant formulated in excessively broad terms, which left the prosecution authorities unrestricted discretion in determining which documents were “of interest” for the criminal investigation ( Kruglov and Others v. Russia , 2020, § 127; Aleksanyan v. Russia , 2008, § 216; Svetova and Others v. Russia , 2023, §§ 41-46); ▪ a search warrant based on reasonable suspicion but worded in excessively general terms (Roba thin v. Austria , 2012, § 52); ▪ a warrant authorising the police to seize, for a period of two full months, the applicant ’s entire computer and all his floppy disks, containing material covered by legal professional privilege ( Iliya Stefanov v. Bulgaria , 2008, §§ 41-42).
▪ a warrant allowing for the seizure of electronic data protected by lawyer -client professional secrecy for the purposes of criminal proceedings against another lawyer who had shared the applicant ’s office; and the refusal to return or destroy them in the absence of sufficient procedural guarantees in the relevant legislation as interpreted and applied by the judicial authorities ( Kırdök and Others v. Turkey , 2019, §§ 52-58).
A police search may be deemed disproportionate where it has not been preceded by reasonable and a vailable precautions ( Keegan v. the United Kingdom , 2006, §§ 33-36 in which there had been a lack of adequate prior verification of the identities of the residents of the premises searched), or where the action taken was excessive ( Vasylchuk v. Ukraine , 2013, §§ 80 and 84).
A police raid at 6 a.m., without adequate reason, of the home of an absent person who was not the prosecuted person but the victim, was found not to have been “necessary” in a democratic society ( Zubaľ v. Slovakia , 2010, §§ 41-45, where the Court also noted the impact on the reputation of the person concerned).

"How does the Court assess the legality of domestic measures and restrictions when confronted with a sequence of repetitive measures targeting a specific individual, forming a pattern of misuse of power?","A sequence of repetitive measures specifically and personally targeting an applicant can be analysed as a continuing situation, in which the predominant purpose may vary over the period under examination .
The repetitive nature of restrictions imposed by a respondent State in pursuance of ulterior purposes is an important factor to consider.
Faced with a series of similar cases brought by different applicants, or a sequence of identical measures directed against the same applicant, the Court will assess whether such instances, viewed as a whole, amount to a pattern of misuse of power targeting specific groups or individuals ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 167-170; and Aliyev v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 223).
Where this is the case, the Court will consider whether any subsequent well -founded allegations of ulterior purposes against the impugned State belong to the established pattern ( Navalnyy v. Russia (no. 2) , 2019, § 94; Natig Jafarov v. Azerbaijan , 2019, § § 64-65; Ibrahimov and Mammadov v. Azerbaijan , 2020, §§151 -152; Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan (no. 2) , 2020, § § 113-114; and Yunusova and Yunusov v. Azerbaijan (no. 2) , 2020, § 187-188; Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 76).
The Court may also establish a pattern of misuse of power on the basis of a single case, where domestic context provides sufficient evidence that it is not an isolated example and that identical restrictions affect a significant number of persons belonging to the same category or group as the applicant (Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § § 427-428).
When examining a sequence of events, the Court may analyse whether , viewed as a whole, they disclose a certain pattern indicative of specific and personal targeting ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 167-170).
The Court may also have regard to its own findings in previous related cases brought by the same applicant.
The authorities ’ awareness at the material time that the contested practice was incompatible with Convention standards, is a relevant factor to consider ( Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 171).
In this context, the Court takes into account indications of pressure on the part of the authorities and/or State -supported media in connection with the applicant ’s status and activities .
The Court further examine s the relevant proceedings in order to establish whether procedural defects taken together are indicative of an ulterior purpose behind the contested measure.
The Court also relies on the overall context and the political and social climate concerning the relevant group or category of actors (Kogan and Others v. Russia , 2023, § § 71-76).",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_18,"[53, 54, 55, 57, 102, 121]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court assesses the legality of domestic measures and restrictions when confronted with a sequence of repetitive measures targeting a specific individual, forming a pattern of misuse of power.

"How does the Court determine whether an impugned restriction based on a domestic legislative provision, applied indiscriminately, constitutes evidence of an ulterior motive as alleged by the applicants in the context of Article 18 of the Convention?","Where an impugned restriction is based on a domestic legislative provision, which, though lacking a legitimate aim and/or requisite justification, is applied indiscriminately to all its addressees, the Court will be unable to find , in the fact of its application in a given case , evidence of an ulterior motive as alleged by the applicants ( Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia (no. 2) , 2020, § § 624-625).
The Court has previously Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights acknowledged its competence to examine allegations of political or other ulterior motives for pre -trial detention in so far as it may dissociate pre -trial detention from the criminal proceedings within which such detention was ordered (Navalnyy v. Russia (no. 2) , 2019, § 85; Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (infringement proceedings) [GC], 2019, § 185; Lutsenko v. Ukraine , 2012, § 108; Tymoshenko v. Ukraine , 2013, § 298; and Tchankotadze v. Georgia , 2016, § 114).
When considering an allegation under Article 18 , the Court must therefore establish: ▪ whether the restriction of the applicant ’s right or freedom was applied for an ulterior purpose; ▪ whether the restriction pursued both a purpose prescribed by the Convention and an ulterior one, that is, whether there was a plurality of purposes; ▪ which purpose was predominant ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 309).
A restriction can be compatible with the substantive Convention provision which authorises it because it pursues an aim permissible under that provision, but still infringe Article 18 because the prescribed purpose, while present, was in reality simply a cover enabling the aut horities to attain an extraneous purpose, which was the overriding focus of their efforts ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 305).
In other words, if it is established that a restriction also p ursued an ulterior purpose, there will only be a breach of Article 18 if the ulterior purpose is predominant ( ibid. , § 318; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; and Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 211-213; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 199; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 314; Kogan and Others v. Russia , 2023, § 68).
In assessing this point, the Court will analyse the extent to which the authorities were determined to pursue the alleged ulterior purpose ( Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 329).
It will give weight to the following considerations: in the first place, whether the authorities attached the utmost importance to their actions targeting a specific individual or a group; and whether a given case belongs to an established pattern of misuse of power by the respondent State ( Azizov and Novruzlu v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § § 76-77).
The above factors are also of relevance in the context of disciplinary proceedings ( Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, §§ 205-213; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § § 322-337).
Where the case Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights circumstances indicate that such proceedings and the imposed sanctions are tainted by ulterior motives, the Court will scrutinise whether the domestic judicial review has properly addressed this issue, in light of the applicant ’s allegations ( Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 212).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_18,"[110, 111, 112, 38, 45, 48, 115]",legal-sentence-level-cot-with-search-v2,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the Court determines whether an impugned restriction based on a domestic legislative provision, applied indiscriminately, constitutes evidence of an ulterior motive as alleged by the applicants in the context of Article 18 of the Convention.

"What factors should be considered to determine whether a detention is considered ""after conviction by a competent court"" under Article 5 § 1 (a) of the ECHR?","The term “after” does not simply mean that the detention must follow the conviction in point of time: in addition, the detention must result from, follow and depend upon or occur by virtue of the conviction. In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, 2012, § 189; Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom, 1987, § 40; Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], 2013, § 124).
However, with the passage of time, the causal link gradually becomes less strong and might eventually be broken if a position were reached in which a decision not to release and to re-detain (including the prolonging of preventive detention) were based on grounds unconnected to the objectives of the legislature or the court or on an assessment that was unreasonable in terms of those objectives. In those circumstances, a detention that was lawful at the outset would be transformed into a deprivation of liberty that was arbitrary and, hence, incompatible with Article 5 (ibid., § 124; and H.W. v. Germany, 2013, § 102; M. v. Germany, 2009, § 88, for continued preventive detention; W.A. v. Switzerland, 2021, §§ 39-45, where the order for the applicant’s preventive detention made in a reopening procedure was incompatible with the aims of his initial conviction).
The Court has found that various forms of preventive detention beyond the prison sentence constituted an applicant’s detention “after conviction by a competent court.” In such circumstances the detention at issue was not part of a penalty, but rather ensued from another “measure involving deprivation of liberty” (see Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, 2015, § 51 with further references).
A decision not to release a detainee may become inconsistent with the objectives of the sentencing court’s detention order if the person concerned continued to be detained on the grounds of a risk that he or she would reoffend, but the person is, at the same time, deprived of the necessary means, such as suitable therapy, to demonstrate that he or she was no longer dangerous (Klinkenbuß v. Germany, 2016, § 47).
The reasonableness of the decision to extend a person’s detention in order to protect the public is called into question where the domestic courts plainly had at their disposal insufficient elements warranting the conclusion that the person concerned was still dangerous to the public, notably because the courts failed to obtain indispensable and sufficiently recent expert advice. The question whether medical expertise was sufficiently recent is not answered by the Court in a static way but depends on the specific circumstances of the case, in particular, whether there were potentially significant changes in the applicant’s situation since the last examination by an expert (D.J. v. Germany, 2017, §§ 59-61). Moreover, when the offender has been detained in the same institution for a considerable time and his therapeutic treatment has reached a deadlock, it is particularly important to consult an external expert in order to obtain fresh propositions for initiating the necessary treatment (Tim Henrik Bruun Hansen v. Denmark, 2019, §§ 77-78).
A defendant is considered to be detained “after conviction by a competent court” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (a) once the judgment has been delivered at first instance, even where it is not yet enforceable and remains amenable to appeal (Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, 2015, § 46). The term “after conviction” cannot be interpreted as being restricted to the case of a final conviction, for this would exclude the arrest of convicted persons, who appeared for trial while still at liberty. It cannot be overlooked that the guilt of a person, detained during appeal or review proceedings, has been established in the course of a trial conducted in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (Wemhoff v. Germany, 1968, § 9).
Article 5 § 1 (a) applies where persons of unsound mind are detained in psychiatric facilities after conviction (Klinkenbuß v. Germany, 2016, § 49; Radu v. Germany, 2013, § 97; X v. the United Kingdom, 1981, § 39). However, it will not apply to such cases following an acquittal (Luberti v. Italy, 1984, § 25).

Germany, 2013, § 102; M. v. Germany, 2009, § 88, for continued preventive detention; W.A. v. Switzerland, 2021, §§ 39-45, where the order for the applicant’s preventive detention made in a reopening procedure was incompatible with the aims of his initial conviction).
A defendant is considered to be detained “after conviction by a competent court” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (a) once the judgment has been delivered at first instance, even where it is not yet enforceable and remains amenable to appeal (Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, 2015, § 46). The term “after conviction” cannot be interpreted as being restricted to the case of a final conviction, for this would exclude the arrest of convicted persons, who appeared for trial while still at liberty. It cannot be overlooked that the guilt of a person, detained during appeal or review proceedings, has been established in the course of a trial conducted in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (Wemhoff v. Germany, 1968, § 9).

What are the essential features and competence that a body must possess in order to be considered a court?,"The term “court” denotes bodies which exhibit not only common fundamental features, of which the most important is independence of the executive and of the parties to the case, but also the guarantees of judicial procedure (Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 1987, § 61; De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 1971, § 78). The forms of the procedure need not, however, necessarily be identical in each of the cases where the intervention of a court is required. In order to determine whether a proceeding provides adequate guarantees, regard must be had to the particular nature of the circumstances in which such proceeding takes place (ibid.).
In addition, the body in question must not have merely advisory functions but must have the competence to decide the lawfulness of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (X v. the United Kingdom, 1981, § 61; Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 1987, § 61).

"What are the different articles of the Convention that applicants have relied on to complain about the effectiveness of the remedy against removal decisions and the lack of procedural safeguards, and how have the Court's approaches varied in addressing these complaints?","In the case of Takush v. Greece (2012, § 49-50), the applicant relied only on Article 13 of the Convention in complaining that the remedy against the removal decision had not been effective, as he had been expelled before the ruling of the Administrative Court. The Court found that, from its reading of the applicant’s complaint, his allegations had to be examined under Article 1 of Protocol No. 7. In the case of Berdzenishvili and Others v. Russia, 2016, §§ 124 and 129, the applicants relied on Article 13 of the Convention in combination with Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 in complaining that they had not had an effective remedy by which to challenge the legality of their removal. After finding no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 on the ground that some applicants had failed to prove that they had been residing lawfully in the country and that others had not been expelled, the Court found that it did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the applicants had an arguable complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 such that it could examineir the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention. In some cases, in addition to Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 applicants have relied on Article 13 of the Convention to complain that they had not had appropriate procedural safeguards in proceedings leading to their removal. Different approaches have been taken by the Court. In the case of Ljatifi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2018, § 45, the Court took the view that, in view of the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 as a result of the failure of the domestic courts properly to scrutinise whether the impugned order had been issued on genuine national security grounds, it was not necessary to examine whether there had also been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. More recently, invoking its position as “master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts” (Radomilja and Others v. Croatia [GC], 2018, §§ 113-115 and 126), the Court found it appropriate to examine the applicants’ allegations only under Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention (Muhammad and Muhammad v.

What are the factors considered by the ECHR when determining whether the piercing of the corporate veil is an appropriate solution for defending the rights of creditors in cases where a limited liability company is used as a façade for fraudulent actions?,"In Lekić v. Slovenia [GC], 2018, § 111, the Court clarified that the general principles established in Agrotexim and Others, 1995, had been applied on a number of occasions, when dealing with shareholders’ claims to be identified with companies for the purposes of “victim” status – that is, “from within” (also Albert and Others v. Hungary [GC], 2020, § 138). However, the Agrotexim line of case-law cannot be transposed directly to cases concerning the lifting of the corporate veil of a limited liability company in the interest of its creditors – or “from without”. In situations, where a limited liability company was used merely as a façade for fraudulent actions by its owners or managers, piercing of the corporate veil may be an appropriate solution for defending the rights of its creditors, including the State, and is not wrong as such (Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, 2013, § 877). Moreover, in cases introduced by creditors of State-owned limited liability companies or banks, the Court has found a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 because of the refusal of the respondent State to pay a debt of the impugned company or a bank, hiding behind the corporate veil (Ališić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], 2014, §§ 114-15). The Court relied in this regard on the following factors: whether the State siphoned the corporate funds to the detriment of the company and its stakeholders failed to keep an arm’s-length relationship with the company or otherwise acted in abuse of the corporate form (Lekić v. Slovenia [GC], 2018, § 111).",4,4,5,3,4,,guide_art_1_protocol_1_eng,[39],multiple-paragraphs,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors considered by the ECHR when determining whether the piercing of the corporate veil is an appropriate solution for defending the rights of creditors in cases where a limited liability company is used as a façade for fraudulent actions.

"How does the concept of jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention apply in different situations, including those involving effective control and territories outside the Council of Europe member states?","Whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority, and thus jurisdiction, over an individual, the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the rights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that are relevant to the situation of that individual. In this sense, therefore, the Convention rights can be “divided and tailored” (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 137); Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], 2012, § 74); Carter v. Russia, 2021, § 126). There can be other situations where the nature of the link between the applicant and the respondent State are such as to permit a finding that that State had indeed exercised its authority or control over the applicant. Thus the Court found that the drowning of an underage Moldovan national during his stay in a summer camp in Romania had fallen under the jurisdiction of Moldova, since his stay on the Romanian coast had been organised by the Moldovan Ministry of Youth and Sport and that Ministry had appointed and mandated three of its officials as group leaders responsible for the young people. Furthermore, it did not transpire from the case file that any Romanian officials had been involved in looking after the young Moldovans, including the victim (Veronica Ciobanu v. the Republic of Moldova, 2021, § 26). As regards the “effective control” principle of jurisdiction over a specific territory, it should be noted from the outset that that principle does not replace the system of declarations under Article 56 of the Convention (formerly Article 63) which the States decided, when drafting the Convention, to apply to territories overseas for whose international relations they were responsible. Article 56 § 1 provides a mechanism whereby any State may decide to extend the application of the Convention, “with due regard ... to local requirements”, to all or any of the territories for whose international relations it is responsible. The existence of this mechanism, which was included in the Convention for historical reasons, cannot be interpreted in present conditions as limiting the scope of the term “jurisdiction” in Article 1. The situations covered by the “effective control” principle are clearly separate and distinct from circumstances where a Contracting State has not, through a declaration under Article 56, extended the Convention or any of its Protocols to an overseas territory for whose international relations it is responsible (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 140; Cyprus v. Turkey, Commission decision of 26 May 1975). The Convention is a constitutional instrument of European public order. It does not govern the actions of States not Parties to it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention standards on such other States (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 141). Clearly, therefore, in the two situations mentioned above, the Court’s jurisdiction ratione personae can only extend to one State Party to the Convention. Indeed, where the territory of one Convention State is occupied by the armed forces of another, the occupying State should in principle be held accountable under the Convention for breaches of human rights within the occupied territory, because to hold otherwise would be to deprive the population of that territory of the rights and freedoms hitherto enjoyed and would result in a “vacuum” of protection within the “legal space of the Convention”. However, the importance of establishing the occupying Concepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability State’s jurisdiction in such cases does not imply, a contrario, that jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention can never exist outside the territory covered by the Council of Europe member States. The Court has not in its case-law applied any such restriction (ibid., § 142, and the references therein). All the cases which the Court has hitherto considered from this angle concerned the control of the territory of a Contracting State by another Contracting State in the context of an armed conflict. In such situations, the issue of “jurisdiction” arises where a State loses effective control of all or part of its internationally recognised territory. The issue of a State’s jurisdiction and responsibility may arise in two different manners in such cases. Where a State attacks the territorial and political integrity of another State, the complaints brought before the Court may be directed against:",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_art_1_eng,"[83, 84, 85, 86, 87]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention in different situations, including those involving effective control and territories outside the Council of Europe member states. It discusses the obligations of a state when it exercises control and authority over an individual, the ""divided and tailored"" approach to Convention rights, and the situations where a state can be considered to have exercised its authority or control over an individual. It also explains the ""effective control"" principle of jurisdiction over a specific territory and clarifies that it does not replace the system of declarations under Article 56 of the Convention. The answer further addresses the distinction between situations covered by the ""effective control"" principle and circumstances where a state has not extended the Convention to an overseas territory.

How has the European Court of Human Rights determined violations of Article 8 of the Convention in cases involving the fair and lawful processing of personal data?,"The Court has examined in a number of cases the question whether the requirement, as stated in Article 5 of Convention 108, that personal data undergoing automatic processing must have been obtained and processed fairly and lawfully, has or has not been met. In a number of cases the Court has found a violation of Article 8 solely on the grounds of a lack of legal basis at national level to authorise measures capable of interfering with the relevant rights (Taylor-Sabori v. the United Kingdom, 2002, §§ 17-19; Radu v. Moldova, 2014, § 31; Mockutė v. Lithuania, 2018, §§ 103-104; M.D. and Others v. Spain, 2022, §§ 61-64). In particular, in Mockutė v. Lithuania, 2018 (§§ 103-104), the Court noted that neither the Government nor the national courts had indicated any provision that could have formed the legal basis for the communication, by the psychiatric hospital, of information on the health of the applicant, who was an adult, to his mother and to journalists. In Taylor-Sabori v. the United Kingdom, 2002 (§§ 17-19), where the applicant had been subjected to police surveillance by the “cloning” of his pager, there existed no statutory system to regulate the interception of pager messages transmitted via a private telecommunications system. In Radu v. Republic of Moldova, 2014 (§ 31), the dissemination by a public hospital of medical information on the applicant’s pregnancy, state of health and treatment by her employer had not been “in accordance with the law”. In M.D. and Others v. Spain, 2022 (§§ 61- 64), the police drew up a report in respect of judges and magistrates, who exercised their functions in Catalonia and who had signed a manifesto in which they had set out their legal opinion in favour of the possibility of the Catalan people exercising a so-called “right to decide”, the report revealing the personal data, photographs, professional information and political views of some of them. The Court observed that the drawing up of the report by the police had not been provided for by law, and since the public authorities had used the personal data for a purpose other than that which justified collection, the mere existence of the police report, which had been drafted in respect of individuals whose behaviour had not implied any criminal activity, amounted to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. In other cases the Court found a violation of Article 8 on the ground that domestic law, which was supposed to protect personal data, was inaccessible or confidential (Vasil Vasilev v. Bulgaria, 2021, §§ 169-170; Nuh Uzun and Others v. Turkey, 2022, §§ 80-99) or was not sufficiently clear and foreseeable (Vukota-Bojić v. Switzerland, 2016; Ben Faiza v. France, 2018, §§ 58-61; Benedik v. Slovenia, 2018; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000; Zoltán Varga v. Slovakia, 2021, § 162; Haščák v. Slovakia, 2022, §§ 94-95). Thus in Nuh Uzun and Others v. Turkey, 2022, §§ 80-99, prisoners’ correspondence was scanned and uploaded onto the National Judicial Network Server on the basis of instructions issued by the Ministry of Justice, directly and specifically addressed to the public prosecutors and prison authorities, which had not been made accessible to the public in general or to the applicants in particular. In the case of Vukota-Bojić v. Switzerland, 2016, §§ 71-77, the provisions forming the basis of the covert surveillance to which the applicant had been subjected by her insurance company after a road accident had not indicated with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the discretion conferred on insurance companies acting as public authorities in insurance disputes to conduct secret surveillance of insured persons. In the case of Rotaru v. Romania [GC], 2000 (§§ 57-62), concerning personal information held by the Romanian intelligence service, national law did not define the type of information which could be processed, the categories of individuals in respect of whom surveillance measures could be taken and in what circumstances, or the procedure to be followed. In Benedik v. Slovenia, 2018 (§ 132), certain legal provisions used by the police to obtain data on a subscriber associated with a dynamic IP address lacked clarity and provided no protection against arbitrary interference, as there were no safeguards against abuse or any independent monitoring of the police powers in question. By contrast, in other cases the Court found no violation of Article 8 after finding that the domestic law was clear and foreseeable and afforded sufficient safeguards against potential abuse (Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], 2017, § 154; Ben Faiza v. France, 2018, § 75). In Ben Faiza v. France, 2018 (§§ 70-76), a court order used to obtain, from a mobile telephone service provider, personal information on the applicant which did not concern the content of the calls, had been “in accordance with the law”. Such court orders were authorised and governed by the relevant statutory framework and there were also safeguards against arbitrariness, as such orders had to be authorised beforehand by a prosecutor on pain of nullity and were subject to judicial review, and the information obtained could be excluded from evidence in the event of any illegality (ibid., § 73). The Court reached a similar conclusion in Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], 2017 (§ 154), concerning a decision by the Data Protection Board, endorsed by the courts, prohibiting the widespread publication of tax data. The wording of the relevant data protection legislation and the way in which it had been applied following guidance given to the Finnish courts by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), had been sufficiently foreseeable. Even though the case was the first of its kind under the Personal Data Act and the Supreme Administrative Court had sought guidance from the CJEU on the interpretation of the derogation in the Data Protection Directive, that did not render the domestic courts’ interpretation and application of the journalistic derogation arbitrary or unpredictable (ibid., § 150). Since the applicant companies were media professionals they should, as such, have been aware of the possibility that the mass collection of data and its wholesale dissemination might not be considered as processing “solely” for journalistic purposes under the relevant provisions of Finnish and EU law (ibid., § 151).",4,4,4,3,4,,guide_data_protection_eng,"[86, 87, 88, 89, 90]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the European Court of Human Rights has determined violations of Article 8 of the Convention in cases involving the fair and lawful processing of personal data.

What are the criteria for the obligation to justify detention under Article 5 § 1 (b) of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"The second limb of Article 5 § 1 (b) allows for detention only to “secure the fulfilment” of any obligation prescribed by law. There must therefore be an unfulfilled obligation incumbent on the person concerned and the arrest and detention must be for the purpose of securing its fulfilment and not punitive in character. As soon as the relevant obligation has been fulfilled, the basis for detention under Article 5 § 1 (b) ceases to exist (Vasileva v. Denmark, 2003, § 36; S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, §§ 80-81).
The obligation must be of a specific and concrete nature (Ciulla v. Italy, 1989, § 36). A wide interpretation would entail consequences incompatible with the notion of the rule of law (S., v. and
The obligation not to commit a criminal offence can only be considered as “specific and concrete” if the place and time of the imminent commission of the offence and its potential victims have been sufficiently specified. In the context of a duty to refrain from doing something, as distinct from a duty to perform a specific act, it is necessary, prior to concluding that a person has failed to satisfy his obligation at issue, that the person concerned was made aware of the specific act which he or she was to refrain from committing and that the person showed himself or herself not to be willing to refrain from so doing (Kurt v. Austria [GC], 2021, § 185; Ostendorf v. Germany, 2013, §§ 93-94). The duty not to commit a criminal offence in the imminent future cannot be considered sufficiently concrete and specific, as long as no specific measures have been ordered which have not been complied with (S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, § 83).
An arrest will only be acceptable in Convention terms if “the obligation prescribed by law” cannot be fulfilled by milder means (Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, 2011, § 136). The principle of proportionality further dictates that a balance must be struck between the importance in a democratic society of securing the immediate fulfilment of the obligation in question, and the importance of the right to liberty (Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 70).
In this assessment the Court considers the following points relevant: the nature of the obligation arising from the relevant legislation including its underlying object and purpose; the person being detained and the particular circumstances leading to the detention; and the length of the detention (S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, § 75; Vasileva v. Denmark, 2003, § 38; Epple v. Germany, 2005, § 37).

When does the Court examine the proportionality and possible legitimate aims of a disputed measure?,"In some cases, the Court found that the impugned measure did not have a rational basis or connection to any of the legitimate aims foreseen in Article 8 § 2, which was in itself sufficient for a violation of the Article. Nevertheless, the Court considered that the interference raised such a serious issue of proportionality to any possible legitimate aim that it also examined this aspect (Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], 2016, §§ 194-196; P.T. v. the Republic of Moldova, 2020, §§ 30- 33). The Court may also find it unnecessary to take a definitive stance on whether the disputed measure in fact pursued any of the indicated legitimate aims because it found that the measure was not necessary in a democratic society (see for instance, Chocholáč v. Slovakia, 2022, § 62, concerning the notions of morality, order as well as the rights and freedoms of others, and more generally the protection of morals, §§ 70-71).
It has been noted that a general measure may, in some situations, be found to be a more feasible means of achieving a legitimate aim than a provision requiring a case-by-case examination, a choice that, in principle, is left to the legislature in the Member State, subject to European supervision (Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2013, §§ 108-109 with further references therein; L.B. v. Hungary [GC], 2023, § 125). A State can, consistently with the Convention, adopt general measures which apply to pre-defined situations regardless of the individual facts of each case even if it might result in individual hard cases (ibid., § 117). However, the Court has indicated that such an approach cannot be sustained in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person’s only home. In such cases, the balancing exercise is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned, and can normally only be examined on a case by case basis (Ivanova and Cherkezov v. Bulgaria, 2016, § 54).

"How does the European Court of Human Rights define a ""conviction"" under Article 5 § 1 (a)?","Article 5 § 1 (a) applies to any “conviction” occasioning deprivation of liberty pronounced by a court and makes no distinction based on the legal character of the offence of which a person has been found guilty whether classified as criminal or disciplinary by the internal law of the State in question (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 1976, § 68; Galstyan v.

What are the factors that the European Court of Human Rights may consider in its assessment of whether domestic law on pre-trial detention provides safeguards against arbitrary detention?,"A breach of Article 5 § 1 has occurred where a lack of any reasons for ordering pre-trial detention was combined with a failure to fix its duration. However, there is no requirement for the national courts to fix the duration of pre-trial detention in their decisions regardless of how the matter is regulated in domestic law (Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], 2017, § 199; Oravec v. Croatia, 2017, § 55). The existence or absence of time-limits is one of a number of factors which the Court might take into consideration in its overall assessment of whether domestic law was foreseeable in its application and provided safeguards against arbitrary detention (J.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2016, § 90; Meloni v. Switzerland, 2008, § 53.)

What may be the consequences of failing to provide reasons for detention orders according to the European Court of Human Rights?,"The absence or lack of reasoning in detention orders is one of the elements taken into account by the Court when assessing the lawfulness of detention under Article 5 § 1 (S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, § 92). Thus, the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time may be incompatible with the principle of protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (Stašaitis v. Lithuania, 2002, §§ 66-67). Likewise, a decision which is extremely laconic and makes no reference to any legal provision which would permit detention will fail to provide sufficient protection from arbitrariness (Khudoyorov v. Russia, 2005, § 157).
However, the Court may consider the applicant’s detention to be in conformity with the domestic legislation despite the lack of reasons in the detention order where the national courts were satisfied that there had been some grounds for the applicant’s detention on remand (Minjat v. Switzerland, 2003, § 43). Furthermore, where the domestic courts had quashed the detention order for lack of reasons but considered that there had been some grounds for the applicant’s detention, the refusal to order release of the detainee and remittal of the case to the lower courts for determination of the lawfulness of detention did not amount to a violation of Article 5 § 1 (ibid., § 47).

What are the criteria for determining whether a deprivation of liberty is considered arbitrary according to the European Court of Human Rights?,"In addition, any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (S., v. and A. v. Denmark [GC], 2018, § 74; Witold Litwa v. Poland, 2000, § 78).
The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (Creangă v. Romania, 2012, § 84; A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2009, § 164).
The notion of arbitrariness varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved. The Court has indicated that arbitrariness may arise where there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities; where the order to detain and the execution of the detention did not genuinely conform to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 § 1; where there was no connection between the ground of permitted deprivation of liberty relied on and the place and conditions of detention; and where there was no relationship of proportionality between the ground of detention relied on and the detention in question (for a detailed overview of the key principles see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, 2012, §§ 191- 95; Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, §§ 68-74).
A period of detention is, in principle, “lawful” if it is based on a court order. Detention on the basis of an order later found to be unlawful by a superior court may still be valid under domestic law (Bozano v. France, 1986, § 55). Detention may remain in accordance with “a procedure prescribed by law” even though the domestic courts have admitted that there had been flaws in the detention proceedings but held the detention to be lawful nevertheless (Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 1998, §§ 55-56). Thus, even flaws in the detention order do not necessarily render the underlying period of detention unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (Yefimenko v. Russia, 2013, §§ 102-08; Ječius v. Lithuania, 2000, § 68; Benham v. the United Kingdom, 1996, §§ 42-47).

It covers various aspects such as the extension of ""arbitrariness"" beyond lack of conformity with national law, the role of bad faith or deception by authorities, the requirement for a genuine conformity to the purpose of restrictions, the need for a connection between the ground of deprivation of liberty and the place/conditions of detention, and the importance of proportionality.

How does the European Court of Human Rights interpret the principle of legal certainty in relation to deprivation of liberty and what are the requirements for domestic law in this regard?,"Where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, § 92; Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], 2013, § 125; Creangă v. Romania, 2012, § 120; Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], 2010, § 80).
Article 5 § 1 thus does not merely refer back to domestic law, it also relates to the “quality of the law” which implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application. Factors relevant to this assessment of the “quality of law” – which are referred to in some cases as “safeguards against arbitrariness” – will include the existence of clear legal provisions for ordering detention, for extending detention, and for setting time-limits for detention; and the existence of an effective remedy by which the applicant can contest the “lawfulness” and “length” of his continuing detention (J.N. v. the United Kingdom, 2016, § 77).

What are the principles implied by the Convention that the ECtHR considers when it reviews whether national law has been observed in cases where failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention?,"While it is normally in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, the position is different in relation to cases where failure to comply with such law entails a breach of the Convention. In cases where Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is at stake, the Court must exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed (Creangă v. Romania [GC], 2012, § 101; Baranowski v. Poland, 2007, § 50; Benham v. the United Kingdom, 1996, § 41). In doing so, the Court must have regard to the legal situation as it stood at the material time (Włoch v. Poland, 2000, § 114). In considering the validity of the order for the detention of a suspect located abroad for 30 days, the Court has accepted as compliant with Article 5 the practice of the domestic courts to count the period of detention from the date of the suspect’s extradition rather than from the date of his arrest in the extraditing State (Gilanov v. the Republic of Moldova, 2022, §§ 51-56).
The requirement of lawfulness is not satisfied merely by compliance with the relevant domestic law; domestic law must itself be in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied in it (Plesó v. Hungary, 2012, § 59). The general principles implied by the Convention to which the Article 5 § 1 case-law refers are the principle of the rule of law and, connected to the latter, that of legal certainty, the principle of proportionality and the principle of protection against arbitrariness which is, moreover, the very aim of Article 5 (Simons v. Belgium (dec.), 2012, § 32).

What are the obligations of the State regarding the protection of individuals' right to liberty under the European Convention on Human Rights?,"Article 5 § 1, first sentence, lays down a positive obligation on the State not only to refrain from active infringement of the rights in question, but also to take appropriate steps to provide protection against an unlawful interference with those rights to everyone within its jurisdiction (El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], 2012, § 239).
The State is therefore obliged to take measures providing effective protection of vulnerable persons, including reasonable steps to prevent a deprivation of liberty of which the authorities have or ought to have knowledge (Storck v. Germany, 2005, § 102).
The responsibility of a State is engaged if it acquiesces in a person’s loss of liberty by private individuals or fails to put an end to the situation (Riera Blume and Others v. Spain, 1999; Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia, 2010, §§ 319-21; Medova v. Russia, 2009, §§ 123-25).

"What are the State's positive obligations under Article 8, and when does the Court intervene in cases with errors or omissions?","In sum, the State’s positive obligations under Article 8 implying that the authorities have a duty to apply criminal-law mechanisms of effective investigation and prosecution concern allegations of serious acts of violence by private parties. Nevertheless, only significant flaws in the application of the relevant mechanisms amount to a breach of the State’s positive obligations under Article 8. Accordingly, the Court will not concern itself with allegations of errors or isolated omissions since it cannot replace the domestic authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case; nor can it decide on the alleged perpetrators’ criminal responsibility (B.V. and Others v. Croatia (dec.), § 151). Previous cases in which the Court found that Article 8 required an effective application of criminal-law mechanisms, in relations between private parties, concerned the sexual abuse of a mentally handicapped individual; allegations of a physical attack on the applicant; the beating of a thirteen- year-old by an adult man, causing multiple physical injuries; the beating of an individual causing a number of injuries to her head and requiring admission to hospital; and serious instances of domestic violence (ibid., § 154, with further references therein), including serious acts of cyberviolence (Volodina v. Russia (no. 2), 2021, §§ 57-58). In contrast, as far as concerns less serious acts between individuals which may cause injury to someone’s psychological well-being, the obligation of the State under Article 8 to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection does not always require that an efficient criminal-law provision covering the specific act be in place. The legal framework could also consist of civil-law remedies capable of affording sufficient protection (Noveski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), 2016, § 61).

What is the state's positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention in relation to criminal law provisions and protection of vulnerable individuals?,"While the choice of the means to secure compliance with Article 8 in the sphere of protection against acts of individuals is, in principle, within the State’s margin of appreciation, effective deterrence against grave acts, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake, requires efficient criminal law provisions. The State therefore has a positive obligation inherent in Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention to enact criminal law provisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through effective investigation and prosecution (M.C. v. Bulgaria, 2003). Children and other vulnerable individuals, in particular, are entitled to effective protection (X and Y v. the Netherlands, 1985, §§ 23-24 and 27; August v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2003; M.C. v. Bulgaria, 2003). In this regard, the Court has, for example, held that the State has an obligation to protect a minor against malicious misrepresentation (K.U. v. Finland, 2008, §§ 45-49). The Court has also found the following acts to be both grave and an affront to human dignity: an intrusion into the applicant’s home in the form of unauthorised entry into her flat and installation of wires and hidden video cameras inside the flat; a serious, flagrant and extraordinarily intense invasion of her private life in the form of unauthorised filming of the most intimate aspects of her private life, which had taken place in the sanctity of her home, and subsequent public dissemination of those video images; and receipt of a letter threatening her with public humiliation. Furthermore, the applicant is a well-known journalist and there was a plausible link between her professional activity and the aforementioned intrusions, whose purpose was to silence her (Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan, 2019, § 116).
The State’s positive obligation under Article 8 to safeguard the individual’s physical integrity may extend to questions relating to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation (Osman v. the United Kingdom, 1998, § 128; M.C. v. Bulgaria, 2003, § 150; Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan, 2019, § 117; E.G. v. the Republic of Moldova, 2021, §§ 39-41). In E.G. the Court held that granting an amnesty to a perpetrator of sexual assault was in breach of the positive obligation under both Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention (§§ 41-50). In the Khadija Ismayilova case, the Court held that where the Article 8 interference takes the form of threatening behaviour towards an investigative journalist highly critical of the government, it is of the utmost importance for the authorities to investigate whether the threat was connected to the applicant’s professional activity and by whom it had been made (Khadija Ismayilova v. Azerbaijan, 2019, §§ 119-120).

What procedural requirements must be followed in measures of interference under Article 8?,"Article 8 encompasses the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. In general, the Court has defined the scope of Article 8 broadly, even when a specific right is not set out in the Article. The scope of each of the four rights will be addressed in more detail below.
While Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the decision-making process involved in measures of interference must be fair and ensure due respect for the interests safeguarded by Article 8 (Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], 2014, § 147). In this connection, the Court may have regard to the length of the authorities’ decision-making process and any related judicial proceedings (T.C. v. Italy, 2022, §§ 56-57).

Under what circumstances may a detention order be considered valid even if there are flaws in the detention proceedings?,"A period of detention is, in principle, “lawful” if it is based on a court order. Detention on the basis of an order later found to be unlawful by a superior court may still be valid under domestic law (Bozano v. France, 1986, § 55). Detention may remain in accordance with “a procedure prescribed by law” even though the domestic courts have admitted that there had been flaws in the detention proceedings but held the detention to be lawful nevertheless (Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 1998, §§ 55-56). Thus, even flaws in the detention order do not necessarily render the underlying period of detention unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (Yefimenko v. Russia, 2013, §§ 102-08; Ječius v. Lithuania, 2000, § 68; Benham v. the United Kingdom, 1996, §§ 42-47).
The Court distinguishes between acts of domestic courts which are within their jurisdiction and those which are in excess of jurisdiction (ibid., §§ 43 et seq.). Detention orders have been found to be ex facie invalid in cases where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing (Khudoyorov v. Russia, 2005, § 129), the domestic courts had failed to conduct the means inquiry required by the national legislation (Lloyd and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2005, §§ 108 and 116), or the lower courts had failed properly to consider alternatives to imprisonment (ibid., § 113). On the other hand, where there was no evidence that the national courts’ conduct amounted to a “gross or obvious irregularity”, the Court held that the detention was lawful (ibid., § 114).

How does the European Court of Human Rights approach the balance between individuals' right to access personal information and the need to protect privacy and confidentiality rights?,"The Court considers that the interests of the individual seeking access to records relating to her or his private and family life must be secured when a contributor to the records either is not available or improperly refuses consent. Such a system is only in conformity with the principle of proportionality if it provides that an independent authority finally decides whether access has to be granted in cases where a contributor fails to answer or withholds consent (Gaskin v. the United Kingdom, 1989, § 49; M.G. v. the United Kingdom, 2002, § 27). The issue of access to information about one’s origins and the identity of one’s natural parents is not of the same nature as that of access to a case record concerning a child in care or to evidence of alleged paternity (Odièvre v. France [GC], 2003, § 43). With regard to accessing personal information held by security services, the Court has held that obstacles to access may constitute violations of Article 8 (Haralambie v. Romania, 2009, § 96; Joanna Szulc v. Poland, 2012, § 87; see also Centrum för rättvisa v. Sweden [GC], 2022, §§ 236-278, and Big Brother Watch and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2021). However, in cases concerning suspected terrorists, the Court has also held that the interests of national security and the fight against terrorism prevail over the applicants’ interest in having access to information about them in the Security Police files (Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, 2006, § 91)45. While the Court has recognised that, particularly in proceedings related to the operations of state security agencies, there may be legitimate grounds to limit access to certain documents and other materials, it has found this consideration loses much of its validity with respect to lustration proceedings (Turek v. Slovakia, 2006, § 115). The law must provide an effective and accessible procedure enabling applicants to have access to any important information concerning them (Yonchev v. Bulgaria, 2017, §§ 49-53). In this particular case, the applicant, a police officer, had applied for a position in an international mission, but following two psychological assessments, had been declared unfit for the position in question. He complained that he had been refused access to his personnel file at the Ministry of the Interior, and in particular the assessments, on the grounds that certain documents were classified. 44 See also the Case-law Guide on Data protection. 45 See the Case-law Guide on Terrorism. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention (Y.G. v. Russia, 2022, §§ 40-45; L.L. v. France, 2006, §§ 445-45 in the context of divorce proceedings). It is crucial not only to respect the privacy of a patient, but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (Mortier v. Belgium, 2022, § 207). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance. They may thereby endanger their own health and, in the case of communicable diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (Y.G. v. Russia, 2022, § 44; Z v. Finland, 1997, § 95; Mockutė v. Lithuania, 2018, §§ 93-94; Kotilainen and Others v. Finland, 2020, § 83). Even the mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual amounts to an ‘interference’ within the meaning of Article 8 (Leander v. Sweden, 1987, § 48) and the need for safeguards will be all the greater where the protection of personal data undergoing automatic processing is concerned (S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 103). For the collection and retention by the blood donation service of personal data reflecting the applicant’s presumed sexual orientation without a proven factual basis, see Drelon v. France, 2022, §§ 79-100.",5,5,5,4,3,,guide_art_8_eng,"[222, 223, 224, 225, 226]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the European Court of Human Rights approaches the balance between individuals' right to access personal information and the need to protect privacy and confidentiality rights.

"What criteria must be met for an applicant to lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights, and who can be considered a victim of human rights violations based on the ECHR case law?","In order to be able to lodge an application in accordance with Article 34, an applicant must be able to show that he or she was “directly affected” by the measure complained of (Tănase v. Moldova [GC], 2010, § 104; Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 33; Lambert and Others v. France [GC], 2015, § 89). This is indispensable for putting the protection mechanism of the Convention into motion (Hristozov and Others v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 73), although this criterion is not to be applied in a rigid, mechanical and inflexible way throughout the proceedings (Micallef v. Malta [GC], 2009, § 45; Karner v. Austria, 2003, § 25; Aksu v. Turkey [GC], 2012, § 51). For instance, a person cannot complain of a violation of his or her rights in proceedings to which he or she was not a party (Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], 2012, § 92). However, in Margulev v. Russia, 2019, the Court considered the applicant to be a direct victim of defamation proceedings although he was only admitted as a third party to the proceedings. Since domestic law granted the status of third party to proceedings where “the judgment may affect the third party’s rights and obligations vis-à-vis the claimant or defendant”, the Court considered that the domestic courts had tacitly accepted that the applicant’s rights might have been affected by the outcome of the defamation proceedings (§ 36; see also Khural and Zeynalov v. Azerbaijan (no. 2), 2023, §§ 31-32). In Mukhin v. Russia, 2021, the Court recognised that the editor- in-chief of a newspaper could claim to be a victim of the domestic courts’ decisions divesting that newspaper of its media-outlet status and annulling the document certifying its registration (§§ 158- 160). Further, in some specific circumstances, direct victims who had not participated in the domestic proceedings were accepted as applicants before the Court (Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania, 2020, §§ 78-81). Standing in domestic proceedings is therefore not decisive, as the notion of “victim” is interpreted autonomously in the Convention system (see, for instance, Kalfagiannis and Pospert v. Greece (dec.), 2020, §§ 44-48, concerning the financial administrator of a public service broadcaster whose victim status was accepted by the domestic courts but not by the Court). Moreover, in accordance with the Court’s practice and with Article 34 of the Convention, applications can only be lodged by, or in the name of, individuals who are alive (Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], 2014, § 96). However, particular considerations may arise in the case of victims of alleged breaches of Articles 2, 3 and 8 at the hands of the national authorities. Applications lodged by individuals or associations on behalf of the victim(s), even though no valid form of authority was presented, have thus been declared admissible (§§ 103- 114).3 If the alleged victim of a violation has died before the introduction of the application, it may be possible for the person with the requisite legal interest as next-of-kin to introduce an application raising complaints related to the death or disappearance of his or her relative (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, § 112). This is because of the particular situation governed by the nature of the violation alleged and considerations of the effective implementation of one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention system (Fairfield v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2005). In such cases, the Court has accepted that close family members, such as parents, of a person whose death or disappearance is alleged to engage the responsibility of the State can themselves claim to be indirect victims of the alleged violation of Article 2, the question of whether they were legal heirs of the deceased not being relevant (Van Colle v. the United Kingdom, 2012, § 86; Tsalikidis and Others v. Greece, 2017, § 64; Kotilainen and Others v. Finland, 2020, §§ 51-52). The next-of-kin can also bring other complaints, such as under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention on behalf of deceased or disappeared relatives, provided that the alleged violation is closely linked to the death or disappearance giving rise to issues under Article 2. For example, see Khayrullina v. Russia, 2017, §§ 91-92 and §§ 100-107, regarding the next-of-kin’s standing to lodge a complaint under Article 5 § 1 and Article 5 § 5. The same logic could be applied to a complaint under Article 6 if a person had died during the criminal proceedings against him or her and if the death had occurred in circumstances engaging the State’s responsibility (Magnitskiy and Others v. Russia, 2019, §§ 278-279).",5,5,5,4,5,,Admissibility_guide_ENG,"[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]",multiple-paragraphs,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the criteria that must be met for an applicant to lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights.

What are the requirements for the defence to prove its allegations in defamation cases and what are the criteria for journalists to report on issues of general interest in accordance with the ethics of journalism?,"With regard to the possibility for the defence to prove its allegations in defamation cases, the Court attached importance – in a case concerning an injunction prohibiting a municipal councillor from repeating statements about sects – to the fact that the evidence proposed by the applicant had been deemed irrelevant and the court had made no comment as to whether it was effectively available (Jerusalem v. Austria, § 45; see also Boldea v. Romania, §§ 60-61; Flux v. Moldova (no. 4), §§ 37-38; Busuioc v. Moldova, § 88; Savitchi v. Moldova, § 59; Folea v. Romania, §§ 41-43). Furthermore, the Court attaches importance to situations where the burden of proof would oblige a journalist to disclose the source of information. Thus, an interference with the principle of protection of journalistic sources would be compatible with Article 10 of the Convention only if there exists a requirement in the public interest overriding this principle (Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], § 90; Kasabova v. Bulgaria, § 65; Cumpănă and Mazăre v. Romania [GC], § 106). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and that they provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (Bergens Tidende and Others v.

What are the obligations of the State authorities in investigating violent incidents triggered by suspected racist attitudes and establishing a possible link between racist attitudes and a given act of violence?,"Where there is suspicion that racial attitudes induced a violent act, it is particularly important that the official investigation is pursued with vigour and impartiality. Moreover, when investigating violent incidents triggered by suspected racist attitudes, the State authorities are required to take all reasonable action to ascertain whether there were any racist motives and to establish whether feelings of hatred or prejudice based on a person’s ethnic origin played a role in the events. This must be done having regard to the need to continuously reassert society’s condemnation of racism and ethnic hatred and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 160; Abdu v. Bulgaria, 2014, § 29). The obligation on the authorities to seek out a possible link between racist attitudes and a given act of violence is thus not only an aspect of the procedural obligations flowing from Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, but also part of the responsibility incumbent on States under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria The Court further specified the scope of the duty to investigate a racially motivated act of violence in Škorjanec v. Croatia, 2017, where the applicant was attacked because of her partner’s Roma ethnicity. Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 thus concerns not only acts of violence based on a victim’s actual or perceived personal status or characteristics but also acts of violence based on a victim’s actual or presumed association or affiliation with another person who actually or presumably possesses a particular status or protected characteristic.",4,5,4,5,3,,guide_art_14_art_1_protocol_12_eng,"[118, 119]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the obligations of State authorities in investigating violent incidents triggered by suspected racist attitudes and establishing a possible link between racist attitudes and a given act of violence.

The Court ruled that where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, public authorities need to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings.

What are the different aspects of voting rights addressed in the provided paragraphs?,"Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 does not oblige States to introduce a system that ensures the exercise of the right to vote for their non-resident citizens. In Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos v. Greece [GC], 2012, the applicants complained that, in the absence of regulation on that point, they could not exercise their voting right in the country where they lived as expatriates (France) even though the constitution of their country of origin (Greece) provided for that possibility. The Court found that there had been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 as the disruption to the applicants’ financial, family and professional lives that would have been caused had they had to travel to Greece would not have been disproportionate to the point of impairing the very essence of their voting rights. However, where national law does provide for such a system, specific obligations may arise as a result, in particular the obligation to hold fresh elections in the foreign country if necessary. In Riza and Others v. Bulgaria, 2015, the Court stated that it did not overlook the fact that the organisation of fresh elections in another sovereign country, even in only a limited number of polling stations, might face major diplomatic or organisational obstacles and entail additional costs. It found, however, that the holding of fresh elections, in a polling station where there had been serious anomalies in the voting process on the part of the electoral board on the day of the election, would have reconciled the legitimate aim behind the annulment of the election results, namely the preservation of the legality of the electoral process, with the rights of the voters and the candidates standing for election to Parliament. The case of Oran v. Turkey, 2014, concerned the inability for Turkish voters living abroad to vote for independent non-party candidates in polling stations set up in customs posts. Votes cast in those conditions could only be for political parties. That limitation was justified by the fact that it was impossible to assign expatriated voters to a constituency. The Court found that the limitation had to be assessed taking account of generally agreed restrictions on the exercise of voting rights by expatriates and, in particular, the legitimate concern the legislature might have to limit the influence of citizens resident abroad in elections on issues which primarily affect persons living in the country. It also emphasised the role played by political parties, the only bodies which could come to power and have the capacity to influence the whole national regime. Furthermore, the limitation also pursued two further legitimate aims: enhancing democratic pluralism while preventing the excessive and dysfunctional fragmentation of candidatures, thereby strengthening the expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. Consequently, the restriction met the legislature’s legitimate concern to ensure the political stability of the country and of the government which would be responsible for leading it after the elections. There had not therefore been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In Toplak and Mrak v. Slovenia, 2021, the Court examined compliance with positive obligations to take appropriate measures to enable the applicants, suffering from muscle dystrophy and using a wheelchair, to exercise their right to vote on an equal basis with others. Acknowledging that a general and complete adaptation of polling stations in order to fully accommodate wheelchair users would no doubt facilitate their participation in the voting process, the Court reiterated the States’ margin of appreciation in this area in light of their limited resources. Given that both applicants voted in a 2015 referendum (about which they had complained), that a ramp was installed at the polling station at the request of the first applicant and that, at the request of the second applicant, a visit to the polling station for his electoral area was arranged a few days beforehand, the Court found that any problems they may have faced did not produce a particularly prejudicial impact on them so as to amount to discrimination. As regards the 2019 European Parliament election, the lack of voting machines was not found to be discriminatory for the first applicant, who was able to be assisted by a person of his own choice under legal duty to respect secrecy. It should also be noted that complaints concerning elections not falling under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 may, if appropriate, be raised under other Articles of the Convention. Thus, in Mółka v. Poland, 2006, the applicant was unable to vote in elections to municipal councils, district councils and regional assemblies. The polling station was not accessible to individuals in wheelchairs and it was not permitted to take ballot papers outside the premises. The Court took the view that it could not be excluded that the authorities’ failure to provide appropriate access to the polling station for the applicant, who wished to lead an active life, might have aroused feelings of humiliation and distress capable of impinging on his personal autonomy, and thereby on the quality of his private life. The Court thus accepted the idea that, in such circumstances, Article 8 was engaged.",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_3_protocol_1_eng,"[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]",multiple-paragraphs,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the different aspects of voting rights addressed in the provided paragraphs.

How can the distinction between collective and individual expulsion be determined in cases involving the removal of migrants?,"In Moustahi v. France, 2020, there was nothing to indicate that the unrelated adult, with whom the two minor applicants had been arbitrarily associated, had sufficient knowledge of the reasons which might be raised against the removal of the children. In any event, there was no evidence that he had been asked the slightest question about the children associated with him or that he had raised the matter on his own initiative. Accordingly, the removal of the two young children, who were not known to or assisted by an accompanying adult, had been decided and implemented without any guarantee of a reasonable and objective examination of their individual situations. The expulsion therefore had to be characterised as collective in nature. Where the persons concerned have had an circumstances, no violation will be found, even if they had been taken together to police headquarters, some had been deported in groups and the deportation orders and the corresponding letters had been couched in formulaic and, therefore, identical terms and had not specifically referred to the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure (M.A. v. Cyprus, 2013, §§ 252-255, concerning an individual who claimed to have been subjected to a collective expulsion operation with a group of Syrian Kurds; compare the circumstances in Čonka v. Belgium, 2002, § 10). The mere fact that a mistake had been made in relation to the status of some of the persons concerned (in particular the applicant, since the deportation order had been issued when his asylum proceedings were still pending) could not be taken as showing that there had been a collective expulsion (M.A. v. Cyprus, 2013, §§ 134 and 254). In Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, the Court clarified that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 does not guarantee the right to an individual interview in all circumstances; the requirements of this provision may be satisfied where each alien has a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against his or her expulsion, and where those arguments are examined in an appropriate manner by the authorities of the respondent State (ibid., § 248). The applicants had undergone identification on two occasions, their nationality had been established and they had at all times had a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against their expulsion had they wished to do so. Although the refusal-of-entry orders had been drafted in comparable terms - only differing as to the personal data of each migrant - and despite the fact that a large number of migrants from the same country (Tunisia) had been expelled at the relevant time, the Court found that the relatively simple and standardised nature of the orders could be explained by the fact that the applicants did not have any valid travel documents and had not alleged either that they feared ill-treatment in the event of their return or that there were any other legal impediments to their expulsion. It was therefore not unreasonable in itself for those orders to have been relatively simple and standardized. In the particular circumstances of the case, it followed that the virtually simultaneous removal of the three applicants did not lead to the conclusion that their expulsion was collective (ibid., §§ 249-254). The Court reached a similar conclusion in Asady and Others v. Slovakia, 2020 (in respect of the removal of the applicants to Ukraine by the Slovak border police, based on standard expulsion decisions after brief interviews with standardised questions in the presence of an interpreter at the police station, §§ 63-71) and in M.A. and Others v. Latvia ((dec.), 2022, concerning the applicants’ removal from the Indra border crossing point to Belarus, §§ 69-71), finding in both cases that the applicants had had a sufficient opportunity to put forward arguments against their removal and to have their individual situation examined. In Shioshvili and Others v. Russia, 2016, §§ 70-72, and Berdzenishvili and Others v. Russia, 2016, §§ 81-82, in the absence of any expulsion order from a court or any other authority against the applicants, the Court was unable to conclude that they had been the subject of a “measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country”. This held true even if an administrative practice in place at the relevant time had led the applicants in both cases to fear arrest, detention and expulsion and it was therefore understandable that they might leave the country in anticipation of an expulsion order. Nonetheless, although the situation of the applicants in itself might contain elements of compulsion to leave, it could not be equated with an expulsion decision or other official coercive measure. The Court found no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in such circumstances.",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_art_4_protocol_4_eng,"[24, 26, 27, 28]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the distinction between collective and individual expulsion in cases involving the removal of migrants.

"What considerations and obligations does the Court have regarding the forced feeding of prisoners staging a hunger strike, and what factors must be satisfied to prevent a violation of Article 2 and Article 3 of the Convention?","As regards the forced feeding of prisoners staging a hunger strike, the Court relies on the Commission’s case-law according to which forced-feeding of a person does involve degrading elements which in certain circumstances may be regarded as prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. When, however, a detained person maintains a hunger-strike this may inevitably lead to a conflict between an individual’s right to physical integrity and the State’s positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention – a conflict which is not solved by the Convention itself (Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine, 2005, § 93). According to the Court’s case-law, a measure which is a therapeutic necessity from the point of view of established principles of medicine cannot in principle be regarded as inhuman and degrading. The same can be said of force-feeding that is aimed at saving the life of a particular detainee who consciously refuses to take food. The Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist. Furthermore, the Court must ascertain that the procedural guarantees for the decision to force-feed are complied with. Moreover, the manner in which the applicant is subjected to force-feeding during the hunger-strike must not trespass the threshold of the minimum level of severity envisaged by the Court’s case law under Article 3 of the Convention (Ibid., § 94; Ciorap v. Moldova, 2007, § 77). The Court has also stated that, if a deterioration in a detainee’s health condition is caused by his going on hunger strike and/or refusing to accept treatment, this deterioration cannot then automatically be held imputable to the authorities. However, the prison authorities may not be totally absolved of their positive obligations in such difficult situations, passively contemplating the fasting detainee’s demise. In particular, since a detainee’s decision regarding a hunger strike can be momentous, the prison clinicians must ensure the patient’s full understanding of the medical consequences, verifying, inter alia, that the decision to fast is truly voluntary and does not result from a mental impairment of the detainee or any other outside pressure. No less important is continuing communication between the clinicians and the patient during the strike, when the former verify on a daily basis the validity of the detainee’s wish to abstain from taking food. It is also crucial to ascertain the true intention of, and real reasons for, the detainee’s protest and if those reasons are not purely whimsical but, on the contrary, denounce serious medical mismanagement, the competent authorities must show due diligence by immediately starting negotiations with the striker with the aim of finding a suitable arrangement, subject, of course, to the restrictions that the legitimate demands of imprisonment may impose (Yakovlyev v. Ukraine, 2022, § 43).",5,5,4,4,3,,guide_prisoners_rights_eng,"[172, 173, 174]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the considerations and obligations that the Court has regarding the forced feeding of prisoners staging a hunger strike.

What are the rights of a church or religious organization to lodge a complaint and claim victim status under the European Convention on Human Rights?,"An ecclesiastical or religious body may, as such, exercise on behalf of its adherents the rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention (Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], 2000, § 72; Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, 2008, § 79). That means that a complaint lodged by a church or a religious organisation alleging a violation of the collective aspect of its adherents’ freedom of religion is compatible ratione personae with the Convention, and the church or organisation may claim to be the “victim” of that violation within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. On the other hand, in a case of denial of re-registration of an already recognised religious community, since that community had retained legal capacity to lodge an application with the Strasbourg Court, individual applicants could not themselves claim to be victims of a violation resulting from the domestic authorities’ denial of re-registration, which affected only the applicant community as such. Their complaint under Article 9 was therefore incompatible ratione personae with the Convention (Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow and Others v. Russia, 2010, § 168). At the same time, the Court has acknowledged that the pastors of several evangelical communities could claim to have been personally affected by the national authorities’ dissemination of pejorative and hostile information about their beliefs and their Churches, especially as their standing to bring actions had not been disputed in the domestic proceedings (Tonchev and Others v. Bulgaria, 2022, § 54).",5,5,5,4,5,,guide_art_9_eng,"[10, 11]",multiple-paragraphs,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the rights of a church or religious organization to lodge a complaint and claim victim status under the European Convention on Human Rights.

"Under what circumstances can the work performed by prisoners be considered ""work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention"" under Article 4 § 3 (a) of the Convention?","For example, when the Court had to consider work a recidivist prisoner was required to perform, his release being conditional on accumulating a certain amount of savings, while accepting that the work at issue was obligatory, the Court found no violation of Article 4 of the Convention on the ground that the requirements of Article 4 § 3 (a) were met (Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium, 1982, § 59). In the Court’s view the work required did not go beyond what is “ordinary” in this context since it was calculated to assist him in reintegrating himself into society and had as its legal basis provisions which find an equivalent in certain other member States of the Council of Europe (ibid.; Stummer v. Austria [GC], 2011, § 121; De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 1971, § 90). Regarding prisoners’ remuneration, the Commission has held that Article 4 does not contain any provision concerning the remuneration of prisoners for their work (Twenty-one detained persons v. Germany, Commission decision, 1968; Stummer v. Austria [GC], 2011, § 122). The Court has noted that there have been subsequent developments in attitudes to this issue, reflected in particular in the 1987 and 2006 European Prison Rules, which call for the equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners (Zhelyazkov v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 36; Floroiu v. Romania (dec.), 2013, § 34). However, it has considered that the mere fact that a prisoner was not paid for the work he did, did not in itself prevent work of this kind from being regarded as “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention” (ibid., § 33). For example, in Floroiu v. Romania (dec.), 2013, the Court observed that prisoners were able to carry out either paid work or, in the case of tasks assisting the day-to-day running of the prison, work that does not give rise to remuneration but entitles them to a reduction in their sentence. Under domestic law prisoners were able to choose between the two types of work after being informed of the conditions applicable in each case. The Court, having regard to the fact that the applicant had been granted a significant reduction in the time remaining to be served found that the work carried out by the applicant was not entirely unpaid and that therefore the work performed by the applicant can be regarded as “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention” within the meaning of Article 4 § 3 (a) of the Convention (§§ 35-37). Recently, the Grand Chamber was called upon to examine the question whether Article 4 requires the State to include working prisoners in the social security system, notably, as regards the old-age pension system. It noted that while an absolute majority of Contracting States affiliate prisoners in some way to the national social security system or provides them with some specific insurance scheme, only a small majority affiliate working prisoners to the old-age pension system. Thus Austrian law reflects the development of European law in that all prisoners are provided with health and accident care and working prisoners are affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme but not to the old-age pension system (Stummer v. Austria [GC], 2011, § 131). It therefore considered that there was no sufficient consensus on the issue of the affiliation of working prisoners to the old-age pension system. It held that while Rule 26.17 of the European Prison Rules, which provides that as far as possible, prisoners who work shall be included in national social security systems, reflects an evolving trend, it cannot be translated into an obligation under Article 4 of the Convention. Consequently, the obligatory work performed by the applicant as a prisoner without being affiliated to the old-age pension system had to be regarded as “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention” within the meaning of Article 4 § 3 (a) (ibid., § 132; Floroiu v. Romania (dec.), 2015, § 32). In a case where the applicant complained about the obligation on prisoners to perform work in prison after they had reached retirement age, the Court, having regard to the aim of the work imposed, its nature, its extent and the manner in which it was to be performed as well as noting the absence of consensus among the Council of Europe member States on the issue, held that no absolute prohibition can be found to exist under Article 4 of the Convention and that the compulsory work performed by the applicant while in detention, including the work carried out after he had reached retirement age, could therefore be regarded as “work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention” within the meaning of Article 4 § 3 (a) of the Convention (Meier v. Switzerland, 2016, §§ 72-79).",5,5,5,4,5,,guide_art_4_eng,"[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]",multiple-paragraphs,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which the work performed by prisoners can be considered ""work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention"" under Article 4 § 3 (a) of the Convention.

What is the positive obligation of states under Article 8 of the Convention regarding the recognition of gender change for post-operative transgender individuals?,"On several occasions the Court held that a post-operative transgender applicant may claim to be a victim of a breach of his or her right to respect for private life contrary to Article 8 due to the lack of legal recognition of his or her change of gender (Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014, § 59; Grant v. the United Kingdom, 2006, § 40). Whilst affording a certain margin of appreciation to States in this field, the Court has held that States are required (a positive obligation under Article 8) to implement the recognition of the gender change in post-operative transgender persons through, inter alia, amendments to their civil-status data, with its ensuing consequences (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, §§ 71-93; Grant v. the United Kingdom, 2006, §§ 39-44; departing from the previous case-law such as Rees v. the United Kingdom, 1986; Cossey v. the United Kingdom, 1990; and Sheffield and Horsham, 1998). This positive obligation was later extended to transgender persons, irrespective of their post-operative status, as explained more in detail below (see for example, A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France, 2017; X and Y v.

What are the protections and restrictions of the right to strike according to the ECHR case law?,"Although the right to take strike action has not yet been considered as an essential element of trade union freedom, strike action is clearly protected by Article 11 (Association of Academics v. Iceland (dec), 2018, §§ 24-27, providing an overview of the Court’s case-law; National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers v. the United Kingdom, 2014, § 84). The Court has referred to a strike as the most powerful instrument available to a trade union to protect the occupational interests of its members (Hrvatski liječnički sindikat v. Croatia, 2014, § 59). Strike action is, in principle, protected by Article 11 only in so far as it is called by trade-union organisations and considered as being effectively – and not merely presumed to be – part of trade- union activity (Barış and Others v. Turkey (dec.), 2021, § 45). The prohibition of a strike must be regarded as a restriction on the trade union’s power to protect the interests of its members and thus discloses a restriction on the freedom of association (UNISON v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2002; Hrvatski liječnički sindikat v. Croatia, 2014, § 49; Veniamin Tymoshenko and Others v. Ukraine, 2014, § 77). Secondary action (strike action against a different employer aimed at exerting indirect pressure on the employer involved in the industrial dispute) also constitutes part of trade-union activity and a statutory ban on such action interferes with a trade union’s right under Article 11 (National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers v. the United Kingdom, 2014, §§ 77-78). While restrictions may be imposed on the right to strike of workers providing essential services to the population, a complete ban requires solid reasons from the State to justify its necessity (Ognevenko v. Russia, 2018, §§ 72-73, concerning a prohibition to strike imposed by law on certain categories of railway workers; Federation of Offshore Workers’ Trade Unions and Others v. Norway (dec.), 2002, where the Court accepted the Government’s reasons for stopping a strike of workers on oil drill platforms).

What are the principles and guidelines related to elections as outlined in the ECHR case law guides?,"As regards presidential elections, the Court has taken the view that the powers of the Head of State cannot as such be construed as a form of “legislature” within the meaning of Article 3 of Protocol No. The Court has, on a number of occasions, taken the view that the European Parliament forms part of the “legislature” within the meaning of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], 1999, §§ 45-54; Occhetto v. Italy (dec.), 2013, § 42). As to the actual features of elections, the text of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 provides only that they should be free and by secret ballot, as the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) and then the Court have constantly reiterated (X. v. the United Kingdom, Commission decision of 6 October 1976). The provision further makes it clear that elections must be held at reasonable intervals. The States have a broad margin of appreciation in such matters. The case-law nevertheless provides the following guidelines: “The Commission finds that the question whether elections are held at reasonable intervals must be determined by reference to the purpose of parliamentary elections. That purpose is to ensure that fundamental changes in prevailing public opinion are reflected in the opinions of the representatives of the people. Parliament must in principle be in a position to develop and execute its legislative intentions – including longer term legislative plans. Too short an interval between elections may impede political planning for the implementation of the will of the electorate; too long an interval can lead to the petrification of political groupings in Parliament which may no longer bear any resemblance to the prevailing will of the electorate.” (Timke v. Germany, Commission decision, 1995) The case-law has continued to develop the requirement of universal suffrage, which is now the benchmark principle (X. v. Germany, Commission decision, 1967; Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], 2005, §§ 59 and 62; Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 1987, § 51). However, while Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 includes the principle of equality of treatment of all citizens in the exercise of their right to vote, it does not follow, however, that all votes must necessarily carry equal weight as regards the outcome of the election. Thus no electoral system can eliminate “wasted votes” (ibid., § 54; Partija “Jaunie Demokrāti” and Partija “Mūsu Zeme” v. Latvia (dec.), 2007). However, the vote of each elector must have the possibility of affecting the composition of the legislature, otherwise the right to vote, the electoral process and, ultimately, the democratic order itself, would be devoid of substance (Riza and Others v. Bulgaria, 2015, § 148). States thus enjoy a broad margin of appreciation in the organisation of the ballot. An electoral boundary review giving rise to constituencies of unequal population does not breach Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 provided that the free will of the people is accurately reflected (Bompard v. France (dec.), 2006). Lastly, the choice of electoral system by which the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature is ensured – whether it be based on proportional representation, the “first-past-the-post” system or some other arrangement – is a matter in which the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation (Matthews v. the United Kingdom [GC], 1999, § 64).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_art_3_protocol_1_eng,"[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the principles and guidelines related to elections as outlined in the ECHR case law guides.

"How does the European Court of Human Rights determine the applicability of Article 8 in cases involving pollution, nuisance, and environmental hazards?","Depending on the circumstances, the severity threshold may be reached even where the pollution or noise complained of it is only occasional (see Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 38, concerning noise from fireworks let off only during two separate weeks annually ). A person’s health does not necessarily have to be affected, or even threatened, for an issue to arise under Article 8 on the grounds of his or her exposure to pollution or other nuisance (Lόpez Ostra v. Spain, 1994, § 51; see also: Sciavilla v. Italy (dec.), 2000; Botti v. Italy (dec.), 2004; Kyrtatos v. Greece, 2003, § 52; Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, 2004, § 113; Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), 2008; Furlepa v. Poland (dec.), 2008; Greenpeace E.V. and Others v. Germany (dec.), 2009; Marchiş and Others v. Romania (dec.), 2011; Zammit Maempel v. Malta, 2011, § 36; Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, 2014, § 88; Jugheli and Others v. Georgia, 2017, § 62; Yevgeniy Dmitriyev v. Russia, 2020, § 32; Solyanik v. Russia, 2022, § 41; Pavlov and Others v. Russia, 2022, § 69; Kotov and Others v. Russia, 2022, § 108). This is illustrated by the case of Brânduşe v. Romania, 2006, § 67, concerning offensive odours affecting a person detained in a prison near a rubbish tip. The Court pointed out that the fact that the applicant’s state of health had not deteriorated was insufficient to rule out the applicability of Article 8. It deduced the provision’s applicability from the fact that the impugned nuisance had affected his quality of life and his well-being. Similarly, in Di Sarno and Others v. Italy, 2012, § 108, the Court noted that the applicants, who had been forced to live in an environment polluted by refuse left in the streets for several months, had not alleged that they had fallen ill, and that there was no evidence that their lives and health had been in danger. It did, however, consider that this situation could have led to a deterioration of the applicants’ quality of life and, in particular, have adversely affected their right to respect for their homes and their family life, and emphasised that “Article 8 may be relied on even in the absence of any evidence of a serious danger to people’s health”. That being so, the fact that the severity threshold has been reached can be deduced even more easily where pollution or another nuisance had affected human health (Fadeyeva v. Russia, 2005, § 88; Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, 2006, § 100; Băcilă v. Romania, 2010, §§ 63-64; see, by contrast, the following: Borysiewicz v. Poland, 2008, § 54; Ruano Morcuende v. Spain (dec.), 2005; Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), 2008; Furlepa v. Poland (dec.), 2008). European Court of Human Rights 27/94 Updated: 31.08.2023 Guide on case-law of the Convention – Environment The exposure of a person to an environmental hazard as opposed to pollution or nuisance whose effects he or she experiences directly may be sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8. The environmental hazard in question must be such as to impinge significantly on the person’s ability to enjoy his home or private or family life (McGinley and Egan v. United Kingdom, 1998, §§ 96-97; Roche v. United Kingdom [GC], 2005, § 155-156; Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, 2011, §§ 105 and 111; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom, 2012, § 192; Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, 2014, §§ 81- 84; Cordella and Others v. Italy, 2019, §§ 157 and 172). The Court has, in particular, found Article 8 to apply where the dangerous effects of an activity to which the individuals concerned are likely to be exposed have been determined under an environmental impact assessment procedure in such a way as to establish a sufficiently close link with private and family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention (Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, 2004, §§ 112-113; Öçkan and Others v. Turkey, 2006, § 39; Hardy and Maile v. United Kingdom, 2012, § 189; Thibaut v. France (dec.), 2022, § 38), even where the dangerous activity is still in the planning stages (Thibaut v. France (dec.), 2022, § 38). The Court has emphasised that if this were not the case, the positive obligation on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant’s rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 would be set at naught (Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, 2004, § 113). The danger in question must be characterised in the light of the applicant’s situation, as illustrated by the decisions in the cases of Folkman and Others v. Czech Republic (dec.), 2006, and Sdružení Jihočeské Matky v. Czech Republic (dec.), 2006. In those cases, individuals living in the area covered by the damage control plan for the Temelin nuclear power station who had considered that the operation of the power station posed a threat to the environment, public health and human life, had unsuccessfully lodged an action with the Constitutional Court to set aside the decision to start operations. Having observed, when assessing the complaint under Article 6, that the applicants had been complaining about the overall danger of using nuclear energy rather than a specific and imminent threat to their own health or lives, thus putting forward arguments relevant to an actio popularis, the Court declared the complaint under Article 8 unarguable, in view of the highly tenuous link between the impugned decision and the rights secured under that provision.",5,5,4,5,4,,guide_environment_eng,"[68, 69, 70, 71, 72]",multiple-paragraphs,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the European Court of Human Rights determines the applicability of Article 8 in cases involving pollution, nuisance, and environmental hazards.

What is the historical basis of the absolute right to enter the territory of one's own country and the prohibition of exile or banishment?,"The right to enter the territory of which one is a national is recognised in terms that do not admit of any exception. Indeed, it contains no express restrictions (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, §§ 248 and 252). As can be seen from the preparatory work on Protocol No. 4, the object of the right to enter the territory of a State of which one is a national is to prohibit the exile of nationals, a measure of banishment that has, at certain times in history, been enforced against specific categories of individuals (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, § 260). The preparatory work shows that the prohibition of “exile” was supposed to be absolute in the Council of Europe framework, and that the same was therefore true of the right to enter one’s country, as the possibility of exile not being arbitrary was not admitted (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, § 126). The absolute prohibition on the expulsion of nationals and the corresponding absolute nature of the right to enter national territory stems historically from the intention to prohibit, once and for all and in an equally absolute manner, the exile of nationals, as it was seen to be incompatible with modern democratic principles (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, §§ 210 and 248). This historical basis is reflected in the long-standing case-law of the Commission and the Court in response to complaints about the compatibility of the banishment of members of royal families with the right of entry under Article 3 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 (H.F. and Others v. France [GC], 2022, § 210 ; see below).",5,5,4,5,4,,guide_art_3_protocol_4_eng,"[56, 57, 58, 59, 60]",multiple-paragraphs,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the historical basis of the absolute right to enter one's own country and the prohibition of exile or banishment.

How does the European Court of Human Rights consider the vulnerable status of migrants/asylum seekers and their well-being in relation to their Convention rights?,"This Chapter will consider the social dimension of the Court’s case-law relating to certain vulnerable groups such as migrants/asylum seekers, persons with disabilities and Roma people. In its assessment of their Convention rights, the Court pays particular attention to the vulnerable status of migrants/asylum-seekers given their precarious situation and past experiences (M.S.S. 29 See also, Case-Law Guide on Immigration of the European Convention on Human Rights. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], 2011, §§ 232 and 251; B.G. and Others v. France, 2020, § 78). This is particularly so when children are involved, to which the Court has referred to as being in a situation of “extreme vulnerability”, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, that takes precedence over considerations relating to his or her status as an irregular migrant (N.T.P. and Others v. France, 2018, § 44; Khan v. France, 2019, §§ 73-74 and §§ 92-93; B.G. and Others v. France, 2020, § 79). The Court has reiterated that Article 3 does not oblige States to provide everyone within their jurisdiction with a home nor to give migrants financial assistance to enable them to maintain a certain standard of living, but the responsibility of the State may be engaged under Article 3 where an applicant, in circumstances wholly dependent on State support, finds himself/herself faced with official indifference in a situation of serious deprivation or want incompatible with human dignity (M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], 2011, §§ 249 and 253; Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC], 2014, §§ 95 and 98). In M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], 2011, the Court examined under Article 3 complaints of an asylum-seeker who was living on the streets for several months in a state of extreme poverty without any means of subsistence (unable to cater for most basic needs such as food and hygiene) and under the constant fear of being attacked and robbed. The Court found a violation of Article 3 on account of the failure by the respondent State to have due regard to the applicant’s vulnerability as an asylum-seeker and their inaction in the particularly serious situation in which he had found himself for months. It considered that the applicant had been the victim of humiliating treatment showing a lack of respect for his dignity and that this situation had aroused in him feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of inducing desperation. His living conditions, combined with the prolonged uncertainty in which he had remained and the total lack of any prospects of his situation improving, had attained the level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention (§§ 263-264). A similar conclusion was reached by the Court in N.H. and Others v. France, 2020, concerning asylum seekers who, due to administrative delays preventing them from receiving the support provided for by law pending their asylum application, were forced to live rough in the street for several months, without access to sanitary facilities, having no means of subsistence and constantly in fear of being attacked or robbed. The Court found that the authorities had failed to fulfil their duties towards the applicants under domestic law and had not provided an appropriate response upon being alerted of the applicants’ precarious situation. Accordingly, the applicants had been victims of degrading treatment, with the authorities showing disrespect for their dignity, that had exceeded the threshold of severity for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention (§§ 165-186). On the other hand, the Court held that the Article 3 threshold was not reached in respect of one applicant who had also lived in a tent for months but who had received documents certifying his asylum-seeker status and financial assistance within a comparatively shorter period of time (§ 187).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_social_rights_eng,"[199, 200, 201, 202]",multiple-paragraphs,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of how the European Court of Human Rights considers the vulnerable status of migrants/asylum seekers and their well-being in relation to their Convention rights.

Under what circumstances can a removal be considered a collective expulsion according to the European Court of Human Rights case law?,"Where the persons concerned have had an circumstances, no violation will be found, even if they had been taken together to police headquarters, some had been deported in groups and the deportation orders and the corresponding letters had been couched in formulaic and, therefore, identical terms and had not specifically referred to the earlier decisions regarding the asylum procedure (M.A. v. Cyprus, 2013, §§ 252-255, concerning an individual who claimed to have been subjected to a collective expulsion operation with a group of Syrian Kurds; compare the circumstances in Čonka v. Belgium, 2002, § 10). The mere fact that a mistake had been made in relation to the status of some of the persons concerned (in particular the applicant, since the deportation order had been issued when his asylum proceedings were still pending) could not be taken as showing that there had been a collective expulsion (M.A. v. Cyprus, 2013, §§ 134 and 254). In Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016, the Court clarified that Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 does not guarantee the right to an individual interview in all circumstances; the requirements of this provision may be satisfied where each alien has a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against his or her expulsion, and where those arguments are examined in an appropriate manner by the authorities of the respondent State (ibid., § 248). The applicants had undergone identification on two occasions, their nationality had been established and they had at all times had a genuine and effective possibility of submitting arguments against their expulsion had they wished to do so. Although the refusal-of-entry orders had been drafted in comparable terms - only differing as to the personal data of each migrant - and despite the fact that a large number of migrants from the same country (Tunisia) had been expelled at the relevant time, the Court found that the relatively simple and standardised nature of the orders could be explained by the fact that the applicants did not have any valid travel documents and had not alleged either that they feared ill-treatment in the event of their return or that there were any other legal impediments to their expulsion. It was therefore not unreasonable in itself for those orders to have been relatively simple and standardized. In the particular circumstances of the case, it followed that the virtually simultaneous removal of the three applicants did not lead to the conclusion that their expulsion was collective (ibid., §§ 249-254). The Court reached a similar conclusion in Asady and Others v. Slovakia, 2020 (in respect of the removal of the applicants to Ukraine by the Slovak border police, based on standard expulsion decisions after brief interviews with standardised questions in the presence of an interpreter at the police station, §§ 63-71) and in M.A. and Others v. Latvia ((dec.), 2022, concerning the applicants’ removal from the Indra border crossing point to Belarus, §§ 69-71), finding in both cases that the applicants had had a sufficient opportunity to put forward arguments against their removal and to have their individual situation examined. In Shioshvili and Others v. Russia, 2016, §§ 70-72, and Berdzenishvili and Others v. Russia, 2016, §§ 81-82, in the absence of any expulsion order from a court or any other authority against the applicants, the Court was unable to conclude that they had been the subject of a “measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country”. This held true even if an administrative practice in place at the relevant time had led the applicants in both cases to fear arrest, detention and expulsion and it was therefore understandable that they might leave the country in anticipation of an expulsion order. Nonetheless, although the situation of the applicants in itself might contain elements of compulsion to leave, it could not be equated with an expulsion decision or other official coercive measure. The Court found no violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in such circumstances.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_4_protocol_4_eng,"[26, 27, 28]",multiple-paragraphs,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which a removal can be considered a collective expulsion according to the European Court of Human Rights case law.

"How does the Court interpret the term ""expulsion"" in Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 and what are the conditions for compliance with Article 4 in cases of unauthorized border crossings?","In N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, the Court was called upon for the first time to address the issue of the applicability of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the immediate and forcible return of aliens from a land border, following an attempt by a large number of migrants to cross that border in an unauthorised manner and en masse. After affirming that the events occurring at the fences at the Melilla land border fell within Spain’s “jurisdiction” for the purposes of Article 1, the Court examined whether the concept of “expulsion” as used in Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 also covered the non- admission of aliens at the land border of a Contracting State, which may at the same time be an external border of the Schengen area. The Court found that the considerations which had formed the basis for its judgments concerning applicants who had attempted to enter a State´s territory by sea were equally relevant in respect of forcible removals from a State’s territory in the context of an attempt to cross a national border by land, and there was no reason to adopt a different interpretation of the term “expulsion” in the latter scenario. The term “expulsion” thus is to be interpreted autonomously and refers to any forcible removal of an alien from a State’s territory, irrespective of the lawfulness of the person’s stay, the length he or she has spent in the territory, the location in which he or she was apprehended, his or her status as a migrant or an asylum-seeker or his or her conduct crossing the border. The term has same meaning as it has in the context of Article 3 of the Convention. Both provisions apply to any situation coming within the jurisdiction of a Contracting State, including to situations or points in time where the authorities of the State in question had not yet examined the existence of grounds entitling the persons concerned to claim protection under these provisions (ibid., §§ 166-188). In the instant case, the applicants had been removed from Spanish territory and forcibly returned to Morocco, against their will and in handcuffs, by members of the Guardia Civil, which constituted an “expulsion” within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4. In N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, §§ 201 and 209-211, the Court set out a two-tier test to determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorised manner and are expelled summarily, a test which has been applied in all later cases presenting precisely the same scenario (see Shahzad v. Hungary, 2021, §§ 59 et seq.; and M.H. and Others v. Croatia, 2021, §§ 294 et seq.; A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia, 2022, §§ 112-123): Firstly, it has to be taken account of whether the State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures to allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms including the Convention. Secondly, where the State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, it has to be considered whether there were cogent reasons not do so which were based on objective facts for which the State was responsible. The absence of such cogent reasons preventing the use of these procedures could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applicants’ own conduct, justifying the lack of individual identification.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_4_protocol_4_eng,"[7, 10]",multiple-paragraphs,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the Court's interpretation of the term ""expulsion"" in Article 4 of Protocol No. 4.

"What are the limitations and obligations imposed by Article 12 of the Convention in relation to the right to marry, including the material conditions for marriage, the impact on disability benefits, the duty to facilitate spouses living together, and the right to have marriage dissolved by divorce?","Article 12 does not therefore impose a positive duty on a State to provide the material conditions to make the right to marry effective or to guarantee that married couples would be in a better position than cohabitees in similar situations. In Marckx v. Belgium, 1979, the Court concluded that the question whether parents of an “illegitimate” child enjoyed the same rights as a married couple and whether Article 12 required that all the legal effects attaching to marriage should apply equally to situations that were in certain respects comparable to marriage, fell outside of scope of Article 12 of the Convention. In F.P.J.M. Kleine Staarman v. Netherlands, Commission decision, 1985, the applicant complained that the provision resulting in a woman losing her disability benefits upon marriage, was contrary to Article 12 of the Convention, since it amounted to a sanction on her marriage. However, the Court concluded that the applicant’s ability to exercise her right to marry was not in any way interfered with by the withdrawal of her disability benefits. Equally, Article 12 does not oblige the States to facilitate spouses living together: this aspect of family life falls to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention (Gribenko v. Latvia (dec.), 2003; Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 1985, §§ 62, 68). It follows that Article 12 does not require States to allow an alien married to one of its nationals to remain on its territory to establish or live in the marital home and found a family there. The Court considered it reasonable for States to impose certain formalities on non-nationals in order to secure the effectiveness of their immigration policies (Savoia and Bounegru v. Italy (dec), 2006). The Court has confirmed, on a number of occasions, that the ordinary meaning of the words “right to marry” covered only the formation of marital relationships but not their dissolution (Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 1986). Such an interpretation was consistent with the object and purpose of Article 12 as revealed by the travaux préparatoires, which disclosed no intention to include in Article 12 any guarantee of a right to have the ties of marriage dissolved by divorce. Moreover, the right to divorce has also not been included in Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, which was opened for signature in 1984. The opportunity was not taken to deal with this question in Article 5 of the Protocol, which guarantees certain additional rights to spouses, notably in the event of dissolution of marriage. Indeed, paragraph 39 of the Explanatory report to the said Protocol states that the words “in the event of its dissolution” found in Article 5 “do not imply any obligation on a State to provide for dissolution of marriage or to provide any special forms of dissolution”.",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_12_eng,"[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]",multiple-paragraphs,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitations and obligations imposed by Article 12 of the Convention in relation to the right to marry.

"What factors should be taken into account when examining the overall fairness of proceedings, particularly in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to legal assistance?","In this context, the Court also takes into account the privilege against self-incrimination and the duty of the authorities to inform an applicant of these rights (Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, §§ 266-273).18 Where access to a lawyer was delayed, and where the suspect was not notified of the right to legal assistance, the privilege against self-incrimination or the right to remain silent, it will be even more difficult for the Government to show that the proceedings as a whole were fair (Beuze v. Belgium [GC], 2018, § 146). It should also be noted that an issue from the perspective of the privilege against self-incrimination arises not only in case of actual confessions or directly incriminating remarks but also with regard to statements which can be considered as “substantially affecting” the accused’s position (ibid., § 178). This is particularly true in the field of complex crime, such as complex financial offences, where the actual incriminating nature of the statements cannot be established so clearly (Bjarki H. Diego v. Iceland, 2022, § 57). When examining the proceedings as a whole, the following non-exhaustive list of factors should, where appropriate, be taken into account (Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 274; Beuze v.

Switzerland , 2016, where the domestic courts had not put the best interests of the child applicant sufficiently at the centre of their b alancing exercise and reasoning) . While States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation under Article 8 of the Convention in deciding whether to impose a waiting period for family reunification requested by persons who had not been granted refugee status but who enjoyed subsidiary protection or temporary protection, beyond the duration of two years, the insurmountable obstacles to enjoying family life in the country of origin progressively assume more importance in the fair bala nce assessment ( M.A. v. Denmark [GC], 2021, §§ 161-162 and 193) , it being borne in mind that the actual separation period would inevitably be even longer than the waiting period ( § 179). The Court found a breach of Article 8 in respect of the statutory waiting period of three years to which the applicant in M.A. v. Denmark [GC], 2021, a Syrian national who had been granted so -called “tempora ry protection status” in Denmark in 2015 , had been subjected before he could apply for family reunification with his longstanding wife.

By contrast, the Court found no violation of Article 8 in the subsequent case of M.T. and Others v.

What factors are taken into consideration when determining if ill-treatment reaches the minimum level of severity under Article 3?,"According to Court ’s well -established case -law, in general, ill- treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3.

In order to determine whether the threshold of severity has been reached, other factors may be taken into consideration, in particular: (a) the purpose for which the ill -treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Conv ention; (b) the context in which the ill -treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions ; and (c) whether the victim is in a vulnerable situation ( Khlaifia and Others v.

What factors does the Court consider when determining the severity of ill-treatment under Article 3?,"According to Court ’s well -established case -law, in general, ill- treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some ca ses, the sex, age and state of health of the victim ( Muršić v. Croatia [GC], 2016 , § 97). In order to determine whether the threshold of severity has been reached, other factors may be taken into consideration, in particular: (a) the purpose for which the ill -treatment was inflicted, together with the intention or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Conv ention; (b) the context in which the ill -treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of heightened tension and emotions ; and (c) whether the victim is in a vulnerable situation ( Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], 2016 , § 160). When assessing whether a person has been subjected to ill -treatment attaining the minimum level of severity, in particular those inflicted by private individuals, the Court takes into account an array of factors, each of which are capable of carrying significant weight.",5,5,4,5,4,,guide_art_3,"[5, 6, 7]",sentence-level-cot,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the factors that the Court considers when determining the severity of ill-treatment under Article 3.

No deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of the permissible grounds specified in sub -paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 § 1 (Khlaifia and Others v.

"What factors does the Court consider when determining whether someone has been ""deprived of their liberty"" under Article 5 of the ECHR?","A deprivation of liberty is not confined to the classic case of detention following arrest or conviction, but may take numerous other forms (Guzzardi v.

Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum ( Mučibabić v. Serbia , 2016, § 126) .
In this context also, the Court underlines that this procedural obligation is not one of result but of means only ( Banel v. Lithuania, 2013, § 66; Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC] , 2017, § 221).
Thus, the mere fact that the domestic proceedings have ended unfavourably for the person concerned does not in itself mean that the respondent State has failed in its positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention ( ibid. , § 221; E.M. and Others v. Romania (dec.), 2014, § 50).",4,5,5,3,5,,guide_art_2,"[41, 42, 43, 65, 212, 222]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that should be considered in assessing whether a respondent State complied with its positive obligation under the European Convention on Human Rights.

5,"Where a difference in treatment is based on sex or sexual orientation the State ’s margin of appreciation is narrow ( Karner v. Austria , 2003 , § 41; Kozak v. Poland , 2010 , § 92).

How does the margin of appreciation affect the State's responsibility to take positive measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens in dangerous industrial activities?,"It considered that they must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be en dangered by the inherent risks.
Among these preventive measures, a particular weight should be placed on the public ’s right to information, as established in the case -law of the Convention institutions and relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels ( Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC] , 2004, § 90; Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, § 132; Kolyadenko and Others v. Russia , 2012, § 159).
As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means.
In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres ( Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, §§ 134-135; Vilnes and Others v. Norway , 2013, § 220; Brincat and Others v. Malta, 2014, § 101).
Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum ( Mučibabić v. Serbia , 2016, § 126) .
If nevertheless damage arises, it will only amount to a breach of the State’ s positive obligations if it was due to insufficient regulations or insufficient control, but not if the damage was caused through the negligent conduct of an individual or a concatenation of unfortunate events ( Stoyanovi v. Bulgaria, 2010, § 61).
Moreover, it recalled that the choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’s margin of appreciation.
There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means (Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 65; Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 102).
In the context of activities which may pose a risk to human life due to their inherently hazardous nature, such as activities carried out on construction sites, States are required to take reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals as necessary, including through regulations geared to th e special features of the activity ( Cevrioğlu v. Turkey , 2016, § 57 with further references ).
In particular, in the absence of necessary safety precautions, any construction site, especially one in a residential area, has the potential for life -endangering accidents that may impact on not only professional construction workers, who are more familiar with the possible risks, but also on the public at large, including vulnerable groups such as childre n, who may easily become subject to those risks ( Zinatullin v.

Under what circumstances can the refusal of citizenship be considered arbitrary and in violation of Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms?,"In the context of the positive duty to take measures to facilitate family reunification, the Court has pointed out that it is imperative to consider the long -term effects which a permanent separation of a child from her natural mother might have, especially since it could lead to an alienation of the child from her Roma identity ( Jansen v. Norway , 2018, § 103).
The denial of citizenship to the applicant was not accompanied by the necessary procedural safeguards and was both arbitrary and in breach of Article 8 (see also Hashemi and Others v. Azerbaijan , 2022, §§ 46-49, in which the authorities had refused to grant identity cards to and acknowledge the citizenship of children born in Azerbaijan to refugees who were settled there).
Although the right to acquire a particular nationality is not guaranteed as such by the Convention (see, for example, S.-H. v. Poland (dec.), 2021, § 65 as 61 See the Case -law Guide on Immigration . concerns children born through surrogacy ), the Court has found that an arbitrary refusal of citizenship may, in certain circumstances, raise an issue under Article 8 by impacting on private life ( Karassev v. Finland (dec.) , 1999 ; Slivenko and Others v. Latvia (dec.) [GC] , 2002 ; Genovese v. Malta , 2011) .

Under what circumstances can the detention of accompanied and unaccompanied migrant children be considered a violation of Article 3 of the Convention?,"Lack of active steps and delays in conducting the vulnerability assessment may be a factor in raising serious doubts as to the authorities ’ good faith (Abdullahi Elmi an d Aweys Abubakar v. Malta , 2016; Abdi Mahamud v. Malta , 2016) .
Obligations concerning the protection of migrant children may be different depending on whether they are accompanied or not (Rahimi v. Greece , 2011, § 63; Abdullahi Elmi and Aweys Abubakar v. Malta , 2016 , § 112).
However, the fact that children are accompanied by their parents throughout the period of immigration detention does not suffice to exempt the authorities from their duty to protect children and take appropriate measures in accordance with their positive obligations under Article 3 ( Muskhadzhiyeva and Others v. Belgium , 2010, §§ 57-58; Popov v. France , 2012, § 91; R.M. and Others v. France , 2016, § 71; M.H. and O thers v. Croatia , 2021, § 192).
Moreover, the conduct of the accompanying parent is not decisive for the question of whether the threshold of severity to 6
In cases concerning the immigration detention of accompanied children, the Court considers the following three factors to be relevant to the assessment of whether there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention: (i) the children ’s young age; (ii) the duration of the detention; and (iii) the suitability of the premises with regard to the specific needs of children ( A.B. and Others v. France , 2016, § 109; M.D. and A.D. v. France , 2021, § 63).
In addition to the three aforementioned factors, the Court has also considered relevant the vulnerability of children in terms of their health or personal history ( Muskhadzhiyeva and Others v. Belgium , 2010, §§ 60-61 and 63, where children ’s psychological problems had been certified by doctors; Kanagaratnam and Others v. Belgium , 2011, § 67, where the children had experienced a traumatic situation in the country of origin; and M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, § 201, where the children had witnessed the death of their sister near the border).
Where accompanied children were detained in poor conditions, the Court found a violation of Article 3 , even if the detention was of a short duration (S.F. and Others v. Bulgaria , 2017: detention for thirty -two to forty -one hours). If the material conditions are satisfactory, the detention of accompanied children for a short period may not meet the minimum level of severity which would engage Article 3 : in such cases, the duration of the detention is of paramount importance and it can lead to a violation of Article 3 ( R.M. and Others v. France , 2016, § 75 (violation of Article 3 in respect of a detention of seven -month old child for seven days )]; N.B. and Others v. France , 2022, §§ 50-53 [violation of Article in respect of a detention of an eight year old child for 14 days]; M.H. an d Others v. Croatia , 2021, § 199).
In certain cases, the Court found a violation of Article 3 in respect of the children, but not in respect of the accompanying parents ( Muskhadzhiyeva and Others v. Belgium , 2010, §§ 64-66; Popov v. France , 2012, §§ 104-105; M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, §§ 205-213).
In other cases , the Court has also found a violation of Article 3 in respect of the accompanying parent, in particular in view of that parent ’s particular vulnerability (M.D. and A.D. v. France , 2021, § 71 (breastfeeding mother ); R.R. and Others v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 62-63 and 65 (pregnant woman w ho had a health condition ); H.M. and Others v. Hungary , 2022, § 18 (woman at advanced stage of high - risk pregnanc y).
As regards unaccompanied children, the Court found a violation of Article 3 in Rahimi v. Greece , 2011, §§ 81-86) on the basis of the applicant ’s extremely vulnerable situation and the very poor conditions of the detention centre, where the fifteen year old applicant was detained for two days (§§ 81-86).
It arrived at the same finding in H.A and Others v. Greece , 2019, §§ 166-170, concerning the detention under “protective custody” of the applicants, aged 14 and 17 years, at a police station for periods between 21 and 33 days, as well as in Abdullahi Elmi and Aweys Abubaka r v. Malta , 2016, §§ 105-115, where the 16/17 year old applicants were detained for approximately eight months in poor conditions awaiting the outcome of the age -assessment procedure ; and in Mubila nzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v. Belgium , 2006, §§ 50-59, where a five year old child was detained in a centre for adults for two months.
The immigration detention of children and adults with specific vulnerabilities will not be in conformity with Article 5 § 1(f) if the aim pursued by detention can be achieved by other less coercive measures, requiring the domestic authorities to consider a lternatives to detention in the light of the specific circumstances of the individual case (as regards children: A.B. and Others v. France , 2016, § 123; Nikoghosyan and Others v. Poland , 2022, § 86; and Rahimi v. Greece , 2011, §§ 108-110; as regards an adult with a medical condition: Yoh-Ekale Mwanje v. Belgium , 2011; see also O.M. v. Hungary , 2016, § 53, with a view to the assessment of the vulnerability of the applicant, an L GBTI asylum -seeker, under Article 5 § 1(b)).
The authorities ’ failure to conduct a proper assessment to determine less coercive alternatives to detention has led the Court to find a violation of Article 5 § 1 in respect of children ( Rahimi v. Greece , 2011, §§ 109-110; Popov v. France , 2012, § 119; A.B. and Others v. France , 2016, § 124; H.A and Others v. Greece , 2019, §§ 206-207; M.D. and A.D. v. France , 2021, § 89; Nikoghosyan and Others v. Poland , 2022, §§ 87-88)
In certain cases concerning accompanied children, in which the authorities had dismissed t he possibility of resorting to a less coercive measure on account of the accompanying parent ’s actions, the Court found no violation of Article 5 § 1 on the basis that the authorities had effectively investigated whether the detention was a measure of last resort for which no alternative was available ( A.M. and Others v. France , 2016, §§ 67- 69; R.C. and V.C. v. France , 2016, §§ 55-57).
Where children are detained with an accompanying parent and the detention decision is only issued against the parent, but not the children, the detention of the children is in breach of Article 5 § 1 (Minasian and Others v. the Republic of Moldova , 2023, §§ 40-42).
Detaining children in inappropriate conditions within the meaning of Article 3 , may of itself lead to a breach of Article 5 § 1, irrespective of whether the children were accompanied by their parents or not (G.B. and Others v. Turkey , 2019, § 151; M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, § 239).",5,5,5,4,3,,guide_immigration,"[34, 35, 36, 33, 45, 106]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which the detention of accompanied and unaccompanied migrant children can be considered a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.

Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features ( ibid.; see Čonka v. Belgium , 2002; Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC] , 2008 ; Nowak v. Ukraine , 2011; Dbouba v. Turkey , 2010) .
Under Article 5 § 2, any person who has been arrested must be told, in simple, non -technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his deprivation of liberty, so as to be able to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 § 4 (Khlaifia and Others v.

"Under what circumstances can detention under Article 5 § 1 (c) be considered necessary and proportionate, particularly when criminal proceedings are suspended due to an unspecified time such as during the Covid-19 pandemic?","When criminal proceedings were suspended for an unspecified time during the Covid -19 pandemic , the basis of the applicant ’s detention during the period in question continued to be for the purposes of being brought before the competent legal authority (Fenech v. Malta (dec.), 2021, §§ 83- 88).
Detention pursuant to Article 5 § 1 (c) must be a proportionate measure to achieve the stated aim (Ladent v. Poland , 2008, §§ 55-56).
It is incumbent on the domestic authorities to convincingly demonstrate that detention is necessary.
The necessity test under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c) requires that measures less severe than detention have to be considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest.
In order for a detention to be justified under the second limb of Article 5 § 1 (c), the authoriti es must show convincingly that the person concerned would in all likelihood have been involved in the concrete and specific offence, had its commission not been prevented by the detention ( Kurt v.

What is the significance of the margin of appreciation in determining the nature and timing of a review of sentence for prisoners serving a whole life sentence?,"The criteria and conditions laid down in domestic law that pertain to the review must have a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty, and also reflect the relevant case -law of the Court.
In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty -five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter ( ibid., §§ 68, 118, 119 and 120).
It has however also indicated that this is an issue coming within the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States in the matters of criminal justice and sentencing ( ibid., §§ 104, 105 and 120).
As for the nature of the review, the Court has emphasised that it is not its task to prescribe whether it should be judicial or executive, having regard to the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States ( Vinter and Others , 2013 , § 120).
It is therefore for each State to determine whether the review of sentence is conducted by the executive or the judiciary (Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2017 , § 44).
The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner.
These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation.
It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological ground s.
A review limited to compassionate grounds is therefore insufficient (Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2017 , § 43).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_3,"[80, 81, 82, 74, 78, 79]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of the margin of appreciation in determining the nature and timing of a review of sentence for prisoners serving a whole life sentence.

Under what circumstances can ill-treatment be considered a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"The Court has also found violations of Article 2 concerning the failure to identify and arraign those responsible for a killing after the lapse of a long period.
In Isaak v. Turkey , 2008 , 11 years had gone by ; in Pastor and Ţiclete v. Romania , 2011, there were more than 16 years between the opening of the criminal investigation and more than 11 years from the date the Convention entered into force for Romania; and in Elena Apostol and Others v. Romania , 2016; as well as Ecaterina Mirea and others v. Romania , 2016, 20 years had passed .
When ill -treatment attains such a minimum level of severity, it usually involves actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering.
However, even in the absence of these aspects, where treatment humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual ’s moral and physical resistance, it may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition set forth in Article 3.
The Court in its case -law considered treatment to be “inhuman” because it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering ( Labita v. Italy ([GC], 2000 , § 120; Ramirez Sanchez v. Franc e [GC], 2006, § 118).
Treatment was held to be “degrading” when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance, or when it was such as to drive the victim to act against his or her will or conscience ( Jalloh v. Germany [GC], 2006 , § 68).
Therefore, any conduct by law -enforcement officers vis- à-vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3.
The fact that the treatment in question took place in public in the presence of a large number of people and was reported in the media may be found to be an aggravating factor ( Navalnyy and Gunko v. Russia , 2020, § 48).",5,5,5,4,4,,guide_mass_protests,"[163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the circumstances under which ill-treatment can be considered a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Under what circumstances does the European Court of Human Rights consider a State to be in breach of its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the treatment of irregular migrants and asylum seekers?,"It may thus raise an issue under Article 3 if the asylum -seekers, including persons intending to lodge an asylum application, are not provided with accommodation and thus forced to live on the streets for months , with no resources or access to sanitary facilities, without any means of providing for their essential needs, in fear of assault from third parties and of expulsion (ibid. , §§ 235-264 and N.H. and Others v. France , 2020, both in respect of adults without health concerns and without children ; contrast N.T.P. and Others v. France , 2018, where the applicants had been accommodated in a privately run shelter funded by the authorities and been given food and medical care and the children had been in schoo l, and B.G. and Others v. France , 2020, where the applicants had temporarily stayed in a tented camp set up in a car park, with the authorities having taken measures to improve their material living conditions, in particular ensuring medical care , the children ’s schooling and their subsequent placement in a flat ).
An entry ban prohibits individuals from entering a State from which they have been expelled.
The ban is typically valid for a certain period of time and ensures that individuals who are considered dangerous or non -desirable are not given a visa or otherwise admitted to enter the territory.
In respect of states which are part of the Schengen area, entry bans are registered into a database called the Schengen Information System (SIS).
In Dalea v. France (dec.), 2010, the Court found that the applicant ’s registration on the SIS database did not breach his right to respect for his private life under Article 8 of the Convention.
It considered the effects of a travel ban imposed as a result of placing an individual on an UN -administered list of terrorist suspects under Article 8 of the Convention ( Nada v. Switzerland [GC] , 2012 ), as well as of a travel ban designed to prevent breaches of domestic or foreign immigration laws , under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention ( Stamose v. Bulgaria , 2012) .
In R.R. and Others v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 48-65, the Court found breaches of Article 3 in view of the conditions to which the applicants were subjected during their stay in a transit zone (see also sectio ns “Confinement in transit zones and reception centres ” and “Article 3 of the Convention: General principles ” and “Children and adults with specific vulnerabilities ” above).
The Court found that the applicants fell within the respondent State ’s jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention as it exercised control over them on the high seas and considered that the Italian authorities knew, or should have known, that the applicants, when returned to Libya as irregular migrants, would be exposed to treatment in breach of the Convention, that they would not be given any kind of protection and that there were insufficient guarantees protecting them from the risk of being arbitrarily returned to their countries of origin.
It reaffirmed that the fact that the applicants had not asked for asylum or described the risks they faced as a result of the lack of asylum system in Libya did not exempt the respondent State from complying with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention.
The removal of asylum seekers to a third country may be in breach of Article 3, because of inadequate reception conditions in the receiving State ( M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC] , 2011, §§ 362-368) or because they would not be guaranteed access to reception facilities adapted to their specific vulnerabilities, which may require that the removing State obtains assurances from the receiving State to that end (see Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC] , 2014, §§ 100-122; Ali and Others v. Switzerland and Italy (dec.) , 2016 ; Ojei v. the Netherlands (dec.) , 2017 ).
In Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga v. Belgium , 2006, §§ 64-71, the Court found a breach of Article 3 in respect of the manner in which a five -year old unaccompanied child was removed to the country of origin, without having ensured that the child would be looked after there.
Situations of ill - treatment by public officials during the deportation process may breach Article 3 (see Thuo v. Cyprus , 2017, where the Court found no violation of the substantive limb of Article 3 on account of the alleged ill-treatment, but a violation of the provision ’s procedural limb due to the authorities ’ failure to investigate effectively the applicant ’s complaints about his alleged ill ‑treatment during the Europ ean Court of Human Rights 48/62
The Court found violations of Article 3 of the Convention (as well as , in certain cases, of Article 13 taken in conjunct ion with Article 3) in these cases ( M.K. and Others v. Poland , 2020; D.A. and Others v. Poland , 2021; O.M. and D.S. v. Ukraine , 2022; for cases concerning similar factual scenarios, but predating Ilias and Ahmed v. Hungary [GC] , 2019, see M.A. and Others v. Lithuania , 2018, and Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece , 2014) .
Where applicants can arguably claim that there is no guarantee that their asylum applications would be seriously examined by the authorities in the neighbouring third country and that their return to their country of origin could violate Article 3 of the Convention, the respondent State is obliged to allow t he applicants to remain with its jurisdiction until such time that their claims have been properly reviewed by a competent domestic authority and cannot deny access to its territory to persons presenting themselves at a border checkpoint who allege that th ey may be subjected to ill -treatment if they remain on the territory of the neighbouring state, unless adequate measures are taken to eliminate such a risk ( M.K. and Others v. Poland , 2020, §§ 178-179).",5,5,5,4,3,,guide_immigration,"[13, 14, 15, 18, 21, 45, 66, 106]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which the European Court of Human Rights considers a State to be in breach of its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the treatment of irregular migrants and asylum seekers.

Under what circumstances can the fair balance between the protection of the right to property and the requirements of the general interest be considered upset in relation to measures restricting the right to property aimed at environmental conservation?,"The Court will verify in particular whether , having regard to the State ’s margin of appreciation , the applicant had to bear an individual and excessive burden such that the fair balance which should have been struck between th e protection of the right to property and the requirements of the general interest had been upset ( Hamer v. Belgium , 2007, § 78; Turgut and Others v. Turkey , 2008 , § 91; Köktepe v. Turkey , 2008, § § 91-92; Consort s Richet and Le Ber v. France , 2010 , §§ 115 and 124; Gavrilova and Others v.

Thus, for example, a deprivation of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference, and a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 only in exceptional circumstances ; that applies whether the expropriation was aimed at protecting the environment or had a different purpose (Turgut and Others v. Turkey , 2008, § § 91-92; Cin and Others v. Turkey , 2009, § 30; Temel Conta Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.Ş. v. Turkey , 2009, § 43; Kök and Others v. Turkey , 2009 , § 23; Yıldırır v.

Turkey , 2013, § 48; Valle Pierimpiè Società Agricola S.P.A. v. Italy , 2014 , § 71).
The judgment in the case of Z.A.N.T.E. – Marathonisi A.E. v. Greece , 2007 , § 54, is worth mentioning because it shows that where a State adopts measures to restrict the right to property with a view to protecting the environment , the fair balance can be upset if the authorities fail to take other action to ensure such protection (see also the Court ’s considerations in the case of G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], § § 295-299, 2018) .

Under what circumstances does the European Court of Human Rights find a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in relation to transgender persons' right to recognition of their gender identity?,"However, safeguarding the principle of the inalienability of civil status, ensuring the reliability and consistency of civil -status records and, more generally, ensuring legal certainty, are aims in the general interest ( A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France , 2017, § 132; A.D. and Others v. Georgia , 2022, § 74) and justify putting in place stringent procedures aimed, in particular, at verifying the underlying motivation for requests for a change of legal identity ( S.V. v. Italy , 2018, § 69; Y.T. v. Bulgaria , 2020, § 70; X and Y v. Romania , 2021 , § 158) .
Legislative gaps and serious deficiencies that left the applicant in a situation of distressing uncertainty vis-à-vis his private life and the recognition of his identity led the Court to find a breach of Article 8 .
This was so on account of a lack of a regulatory framework ensuring the right to respect for the applicant ’s private life, namely one which would provide “quick, transparent and accessible procedures” for changing on birth certificates the registered sex of transgender pe rsons (X v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , 2019 , § 70-71) and not one based on unclear and unforeseeable laws (X and Y v. Romania , 2021 , § 157) or law s not sufficiently detailed and precise (A.D. and Others v. Georgia , 2022 , §§ 75-76). In Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006, §§ 40-44, the time taken for the execution of the judgment in Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, resulted in a violation of the applicant ’s Article 8 rights both for the continued lack of recognition of her changed gender as well as in connection with the consequent refusal to give her the pension rights applicable to women of biological origin, from the moment of that judgment .
According to t he Court ’s case -law, making the recognition of transgender persons ’ gender identity conditional on sterilisation surgery or treatment – or surgery or treatment very likely to result in sterilisation – which they do not wish to undergo amounts to making the full exercise of their right to respect for their private life under Article 8 of the Convention conditional on their relinquishing full exercise of their right to respect for their physical integrity as protected by that provision and also by Article 3 o f the Convention ( A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France , 2017, § 131; X and Y v. Romania , 2021, § 165).
Thus, the Court has held that law making recognition of the gender identity of transgender persons conditional on sterilisation surgery or on treatment which, on account of its nature and intensity, entailed a very high probability of sterility, amounted to a failure by the respondent State to fulfil its positive obligation to secure their right to respect for their private lives ( A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France , 2017, § 135, and contrast it with the earlier decision of X v. France (dec.), 2008 ).
The right of transgender persons to personal development and to physical and moral security is thus guaranteed by Article 8 ( Van Kück v. Germany , 2003 , § 69; Schlumpf v. Switzerland , 2009 , § 100; Y.Y v. Turkey , 2015 , § 58).
The right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention applies fully to gender identity, as a component of personal identity.
This holds true for all individuals, irrespective of whether an individual has undergone gender reassignment surgery (A.P., Garçon and Nicot v. France , 2017 , §§ 94-95, S.V. v. Italy , 2018, §§ 56-58).
On several occasions the Court held that a post -operative transgender applicant may claim to be a victim of a breach of his or her right to respect for private life contrary to Article 8 due to the lack of legal recognition of his or her change of gender ( Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], 2014, § 59; Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006 , § 40).
Whilst affording a certain margin of appreciation to States in this field, the Court has held that States are required (a positive obligation under Article 8 ) to implement the recognition of the gender change in post -operative transgender persons through, inter alia , amendments to their civil -status data, with its ensuing consequences ( Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, §§ 71-93; Grant v. the United Kingdom , 2006 , §§ 39-44; departing from the previous case -law such as Rees v. the United Kingdom , 1986; Cossey v. the United Kingdom , 1990; and Sheffield and Horsham , 1998 ).",5,4,5,5,5,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[62, 63, 64, 55, 60, 61]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which the European Court of Human Rights finds a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in relation to transgender persons' right to recognition of their gender identity. It discusses the aims in the general interest that justify stringent procedures for verifying the underlying motivation for requests for a change of legal identity. It also highlights the importance of having a regulatory framework that ensures quick, transparent, and accessible procedures for changing the registered sex of transgender persons on birth certificates. The answer further emphasizes that making recognition of gender identity conditional on sterilization surgery or treatment that is likely to result in sterilization violates the right to respect for private life. It concludes by stating that post-operative transgender individuals can claim a breach of their right to respect for private life due to the lack of legal recognition of their gender change.

"Under what circumstances does a restriction on an individual's right to pursue their chosen professional activity infringe upon their right to respect for their private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention, as established in Platini v. Switzerland, Convertito and Others v. Romania, and S.W. v. the United Kingdom?","The applicant had received a four -year suspension from any football -related professional activity, and the Court found that the threshold of severity had been at tained on account of the repercussions of the suspension on his private life.
In particular, the applicant was barred from earning a living from football (his sole source of income throughout his life) and the suspension interfered with the possibility of establishing and developing social relations with others as well as negatively impact ing his reputation.
However, the Court subsequently found that there were sufficient institutional and procedural guarantees available, namely a system of private (CAS) an d State (Federal Court) bodies and that these bodies carried out a genuine weighing of the relevant interests at stake and responded to all of the applicant ’s grievances in duly reasoned decisions.
In Convertito and Others v. Romania , 2020, the Court, citing Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], 2018, considered Article 8 applicable to the annulment of the applicants ’ university qualifications due to administrative flaws during the first-year registration procedure ( § 29).
The annulment of their qualifications , for which they had studied for six years, had consequences not only for the way in which they had forged their social identity through the development of relations with other s, but also for their professional life in so far as their level of qualification was called into question and their intention to embark on an envisaged career was suddenly frustrated.
In S.W. v. the United Kingdom , 2021, the Court considered that the decision of a judge of the Family Court to , in the first place, critisise the applicant in strong terms without giving her an adequate opportunity to respond and , then , to direct that those criticisms be shared with the local authorities where she had worked and with the relevant professional bodies, had significantly affected her ability to pursue her chosen professional activity, which in turn would have ha d consequential effects on the enjoyment of her right to respect for her “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 ( § 47).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_8,"[111, 112, 113, 90, 97, 104, 105]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which a restriction on an individual's right to pursue their chosen professional activity infringes upon their right to respect for their private life.

Under what circumstances does returning applicants to a non-European state where they would be at risk of ill-treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention?,"Of particular relevance is the case of B and C v. Switzerland , 2020, which concerned the case of a gay man (in a same -sex relationship) challenging his deportation to a country (The Gambia) where he would be at risk of ill -treatment because of his sexual orientation.
The Court held , for the first time, that returning applicant s to a non -European state where they would be at risk of ill -treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation amounted to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.
In particular, it concluded that the domestic courts which, having taken the view that it was not likely that the first applican t’s sexual orientation would come to the attention of the Gambian authorities or other persons, had not engaged in an assessment on the availability of State protection against harm emanating from non -State actors and had not sufficiently assessed the risks of ill -treatment for the first applicant as a homosexual person in Gambia.
The assessment of the existence of a real risk must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the applicant ’s removal to the country of destination, in the light of the general situation there and of his or her personal circumstance s.
The Court has held that a person ’s sexual orientation forms a fundamental part of his or her identity and that no one may be obliged to conceal his or her sexual orientation in order to avoid persecution ( I.K. v. Switzerland (dec.), 2017, § 24).
The Court will also require the applicant migrant to show specific circumstances which would make him or her personally vulnerable to ill -treatment.
These specific circumstances may be demonstrated by information about previous ill -treatment in the country of destination (ideally supported by medical evidence), through previous grants of refugee status by foreign States or assessments made by the UNHCR or they may be also demonstrated by evidence of current systematic persecution of similarly situated persons .
Where an individual alleges that he or she is a member of a group systemically exposed to a practice of ill -treatment, the protection of Article 3 will enter into play when the individual establishes that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence of the practice in question and his or her membership of the group concerned.
The Court will not then insist that the individual demonstrate the existence of further special distinguishing features if to do so would render illusory the protection offered by Article 3.",5,5,4,5,5,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[27, 28, 29, 26, 31, 37, 38]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which returning applicants to a non-European state where they would be at risk of ill-treatment on the grounds of their sexual orientation would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. It discusses the relevant case law, the need for an assessment of state protection and the risks of ill-treatment, the importance of a person's sexual orientation as part of their identity, and the requirement for the applicant to show specific circumstances of vulnerability.

How does the European Court of Human Rights balance the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life when determining a violation under Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"In cases where the interest competing with freedom of expression is protected by Article 8, the Court ’s approach has been to balance the applicant ’s right to “respect for his private life” against the public interest in protecting freedom of expression, bearing in mind that no hierarchical relationship exists between the rights guaranteed by the two Articles ( Sousa Goucha v. Portugal , 2016 , § 42).
Where the balancing exercise between those two rights has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’s case -law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts ( ibid. , § 45).
Where no matters of public interest are at stake, a State ’s obligation under Article 8 to protect an applicant ’s reputation may arise where the statements go beyond the limits of what is considered acceptable under Article 10 (ibid., §§ 51-52)16.
However, the domestic courts had taken into account the defendants ’ lack of intent to attack the applicant ’s reputation and assessed the way in which a reasonable spectator of the comedy show would have perceived the impugned joke (that portrayed the applicant, a known homosexual, as a female) – rather than just considering what the applicant felt or thought about the joke.
In such circumstances, the Court found that a limitation on freedom of expression for the sake of the applicant ’s reputation would therefore have been disproportionate under Article 10 so that t here had been no violation of the applicant ’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention .
Therefore, the domestic courts had not convincingly established any pressing social need for placing the protection of S.P. ’s reputation above the applicant company ’s right to freedom o f expression.
There had therefore been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention .
In this latter respect, and in order for Article 8 to come into play in defamation cases, an attack on a person ’s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and in a manner causing prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life.
In such cases, the outcome should not vary depending on whether the application was brought under Article 8 by the person who was the subject of the statement or under Article 10 by the person who h as made it, because in principle the rights under these Articles deserve equal respect.",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_lgbti_rights,"[92, 93, 94, 40, 45, 91, 153]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the European Court of Human Rights balances the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life under Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It discusses the Court's approach to balancing these rights, the criteria for substitution of the Court's view for that of domestic courts, the obligation to protect reputation under Article 8, the importance of intent and perception in assessing statements, the requirement for a certain level of seriousness in defamation cases, and the equal respect for rights under Articles 8 and 10.

What factors did the Court consider in determining whether the authorities failed to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect a peaceful demonstration from disruption?,"The Court no ted that the two counter -demonstrations had been prohibited, a large number of policemen were deployed along the route, and they did not refuse the applicant association protection even after the applicant decided to change the route.
By contrast, in Frumkin v. Russia , 2016 , the Court found that the disruption to a peaceful demonstration was a consequence of the failure of the police to take “simple and obvious steps” to provide a reliable channel of communication with the organisers before the assembly, and found a violation of Article 11 of the Convention .
In Identoba and Others v. Georgia , 2015 , given that the organiser of the march had specifically warned the police about the likelihood of abuse, the Court found the law -enforcement authorities to be under a compelling positive obligation to protect the demonstrators from violence.
The Court has explained that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of a protest do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see also Bumbeș v. Romania , 2022, § § 94-96, concerning the application of these principles in the context of Article 10).
Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake , and what risks were represented by the demonstration.
The method used b y the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference ( Primov and Others v. Russia , 2014 , § 119).
The Court took into account a number of factors, inc luding the applicants ’ prior knowledge of the time -limit for applying for authorisation and the clear opportunity to make an application, the limitation of the authorisation requirement to designated security zones, the imposition of defined conditions strictly referable to public interest objectives, the conduct of the police in allowing the applicants to continue with their demonstration and giving them the opportunity to disband without sanction, as well as the modest, albeit criminal , sanctions ultimate ly imposed (see also Csiszer and Csibi v. Romania , 2020, §§ 118-122, concerning fines non-convertible into a custodial sentence ).",5,5,4,5,5,,guide_mass_protests,"[96, 97, 98, 67, 86, 93, 142]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors considered by the Court in determining whether the authorities failed to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect a peaceful demonstration from disruption.

What is the two-tier test applied by the Court to determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorized manner and are expelled summarily?,"In N.D. an d N.T. v. Spain [GC], 2020, §§ 201 and 209 -211, the Court set out a two -tier test to determine compliance with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 in cases where individuals cross a land border in an unauthorised manner and are expelled summarily, a test which has been applied in all later cases presenting precisely the same scenario ( Shahzad v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 59 et seq .; and M.H. and Others v. Croatia , 2021, §§ 294 et seq .; A.A. and Others v. North Macedonia , 2022, §§ 112-123):
Firstly, it has to be taken into account whether the State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures , to allow all persons who face persecution to submit an application for protection, based in particular on Article 3, under conditions which ensure that the application is processed in a manner consistent with international norms including the Convention.
Secondly, w here the State provided such access but an applicant did not make use of it, it has to be considered whether there were cogent reasons for not do ing so which were based on objective facts for which the State was responsible.
The absence of such cogent reasons could lead to this being regarded as the consequence of the applican ts’ own conduct, justifying the lack of individual identification.
The burden of proof for showing that the applicants did have genuine and effective access to procedures for legal entry is on the respondent State and all cases decided thus far turned on whether the State had satisfied that burden of proof ( location of the border crossing points, modalities for lodging applications there, availability of interpreters/legal assistance enabling asylum -seekers to be informed of their rights and information sho wing that applications had actually been made at those border points: compare N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC] , 2020, §§ 212-217; A.A. and Ot hers v. North Macedonia , 2022, §§ 116-122, and contrast Shahzad v. Hungary , 2021, §§ 63-67; M.H. and Others v.

"What practical steps are national authorities required to take in order to protect an individual's proprietary interests in the event of an environmental hazard, such as an industrial-type disaster or a sudden natural disaster?","The positive obligations set out in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 require the S tate to regulate private industry in such a way as to control any pollution o r disturb ances produced (as regards environmental hazards , the regulations must include a preventive aspect ; see below ).
The State’s responsibility under this provision may therefore derive from the lack of appropriate regulations governing private industry .
Furthermore , in environmental as in other contexts , the positive obligations to protect the right to respect for property include the requirement to provide for judicial proceedings covered by the relevant procedural guarantees enabling the domestic courts effectively and fairly to determine dispute s concerning property issues (Bistrović v. Croatia , 2007, § 33; Couturon v. France , 2015, § 33).
It found that the positive obligation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical steps to avoid the destruction of the applicant ’s house as those impos ed by the positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention ( see above).
Such preventive regulations should govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks ( Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], 2004, § 90; Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, § 132; Kolyadenko and Others v. Russia , 2012 , § 158; Brincat and Others v. Malta, 2014 , § 101).
Preventive regulations must, in particular, guarantee the public ’s right to information (Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], 2004 , §§ 90 and 108; Budayeva and Others v. Russia , 2008, § § 132 and 152-155; Kolyadenko and Others v. Russia , 2012, §§ 159, 177, 181- 182 and 185; Brincat and Others v. Malta , 2014, § § 101 and 113-114) , thus enabling them to assess the risks to which they are exposed .
It transpires from the judgments cited that in the sphere of hazardous activities and foreseeable natural disasters such right to information is reinforced by the obligation on S tates spontaneously to provide the relevant information to persons exposed to a mortal risk (see also L.C.B. v. United Kingdom , 1998, § § 38-41).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_environment,"[189, 190, 191, 2, 9, 179, 180]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the practical steps that national authorities are required to take in order to protect an individual's proprietary interests in the event of an environmental hazard.

Under what circumstances does the environmental situation complained of constitute an actual interference with the applicant's private sphere on account of Article 8?,"The distance from the source of the pollution complained of is one of the relevant factors to be considered, but the fact that an applicant does not live in the immediate vicinity is not sufficient to exclude the applicability of Article 8 ( Pavlov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § § 63-66).
For Article 8 to be applicable , the applicant must be able to show that : 1. there was actual interference with his private sphere on account of the environmental situation complained of, and 2. that interference attained a minimum level of severity ( Çiçek and Others v. Turkey (dec.), 2020 , § 29; Pavlov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 61; Kotov and Others v. Russia , 2022, § 101).
In this connection, the State’s obligations under Article 8 only come into play if there is a direct and immediate link between the impugned situation and the applicant ’s home, or his private or family life (Ivan Atanasov v. Bulgaria, 2010, § 66).
In other words, in order to raise an issue under Article 8, environmental damage must have a direct effect on the right to respect for the applicant ’s home, family life or private life (Guerra and Others v. Italy , 1998, § 57; Luginbühl v. Switzerland (dec.), 2006) ; (Fadeyeva v. Russia , 2005, § 68; Thibaut v. France (dec.), 2022, § 38); (Borysiewicz v. Poland, 2008, § 51; Fägerskiöld v.

Ukraine , 2014 , § 77; Kožul and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2019 , § 34; Solyanik v. Russia , 2022, § 40).
This means that general deterioration of the environment is not sufficien t; there must be a negative effect on an individual ’s private or family sphere (Kyrta tos v. Greece , 2003 , § 52; Martínez and Pino Manzano v. Spain, 2012 , § 42) that can be characterised as an interference (Fadeyeva v.

"Does the positive obligation of the authorities to protect individuals' private life and personal data require the enactment of specific legislation in certain circumstances, such as in cases of serious acts between individuals or workplace surveillance, in order to ensure the effective enjoyment of Convention rights?","In certain circumstances where the question of personal data arises , for example in the context of particularly serious acts between individuals , the effective enjoyment of Convention rights requires the State to enact specific legislation to protect those rights .
Thus in the case of Söderman v. Sweden [GC], 2013 , §§ 86-117, the Court found a violation of Article 8 in view of the lack of clear legislative provisions which meant that the isolated act of covert or non -consensual filming/photograp hing of a naked child went unpunished, a gap in the law that was not compensated for at the time by other criminal- law provisions and having regard to the ineffectiveness of civil remedies (ibid. , §§ 108-114).
Similarly, in the case of K.U. v. Finland, 2008, §§ 49-50, a violation of Article 8 was found on account of the lack of a legal basis to enable the authorities to oblige an Internet access provider to disclose the identity of a person wanted for placing an indecent advertisement concerning a minor on a dating site.
As regards less serious acts between individuals, such as monitoring of employees in the workplace , States may choose whether or not to enact specific legislation concerning video- surveillance ( López Ribalda and Others v. Spain [GC] , 2019, § 113; Köpke v. Germany (dec. ), 2010) o r the monitoring of employees ’ non-professional correspondence and communications ( Bărbulescu v. Romania [GC], 2017, § 119).
It is nevertheless for the domestic courts to ensure that any implementation by an employer of surveillance measures interfering with the right of employees to respect for their private life or correspondence is proportion ate and accompanied by appropriate and adequate safeguards against abuse (Köpke v. Germany (dec. ), 2010; B ărbulescu v. Romania [GC], 2017, § 120; López Ribalda and Others v. Spain [GC] , 2019, § 116).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_data_protection,"[80, 81, 82, 7, 78, 129]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the question by discussing specific cases where the lack of specific legislation resulted in a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. It also mentions that in cases of less serious acts between individuals, such as workplace surveillance, states have the discretion to enact specific legislation or not. The answer also emphasizes the role of domestic courts in ensuring the proportionality and safeguards against abuse in implementing surveillance measures.

"Under what circumstances can a court justify disclosing the identity of an individual and other personal data in a judicial decision, and what measures can be taken to reduce the impact of such disclosure on the data subject's right to protection of their private life?","In order to determine, in any given case, whether there are sufficient grounds for disclosing, in the body of a judicial decision, the identity of an individual and other personal data on the latter, one important question is whether other less intrusive measures would have been possible under domestic law and practice.
This includes of the possibility of a court omitting mentioning any names in the judgment permitting the identification of the data subject ( Z v. Finland, 1997, § 113; Vicent Del Campo v. Spain, 2018, § 50), keeping the full reasoning confidential for a certain period and instead publishing an abridged version of the reasoning, the operative part and an indication of the law which it had applied ( Z v. Finland, 1997, § 113), or restricting access to the text of a judgment or to certain matters therein ( Vicent Del Campo v. Spain, 2018, § 50).
In the Court ’s view, by merely declaring, without further explanations, that the applicant ’s case did not correspond to “any of the situations” set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning proceedings held in private session, that court had failed to strike a fair balance between the general interest in ensuring the transparency of judicial proceedings and the litigant ’s interest in preserving the confidentiality of the data on his state of health.
Even supposing that an accused person ’ high public profile may be one of the factors to be taken into account in analysing the proportionality of a request for a private hearing, in this case the court of appeal conducted no individualised assessment of the proportionality of such a measure.
In the Court ’s opinion, the necessity of protecting the confidentiality of certain types of personal data may sometimes be outweighed by the interest in the investigation and prosecution of crime and in the publicity of court proceedings (Avilkina and O thers v. Russia , 2013, § 45; Z v. Finland, 1997, § 97).
The competent national authorities should be afforded some leeway in striking a fair balance between, on the hand, the protection of the publicity of judicial proceedings, which is necessary to uphold trust in the courts, and on the other hand, the interests of a part or of a third person in maintaining the confidentiality of his data ( C.C. v. Spain, 2009, § 35).
Any measure liable to make public an individual ’s personal data, whether he is a party or a third party to judicial proceedings, should meet an overriding social need ( Vicent Del Campo v. Spain, 2018, § 46) and should be limited as far as possible to that which is rendered strictly necessary by the specific features of the proceedings ( L.L. v. France , 2006, § 45; Margari v. Greece , 2023, § 47).
In a case in which the domestic courts had limited to ten years the period for the confidentiality of documents in the case -file disclosing the applicant ’s identity and HIV -positive status, the Court found a violation of Article 8 on the grounds that the judicial authorities had attached insufficient weight to the interests of protecting the p arties ’ and third parties ’ personal data liable to be affected (Z v. Finland, 1997, § § 111-112).
It considered that the serious interference with her right to respect for her private life occasioned by the production in judicial proceedings, without her consent, of information concerning her state of health, would be further aggravated if the medical information in question were to be made accessible to the public after ten years ( ibid. , § 112).
Conversely, in Y. v. Turkey (dec.), 2015 (§ § 81-82), the fact that the applicant’s identity and HIV -positive status had been disclosed in a single decision to decline jurisdiction given by an administrative court, which had not been published or made public in any other way, and was not accessible to the public, while none of the other decisions given in the context of the same proceedings had referred to it, had not been deemed liable to infringe the data subject ’s right to respect for her private life.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_data_protection,"[251, 252, 253, 127, 249, 250, 259]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which a court can justify disclosing the identity of an individual and other personal data in a judicial decision. It discusses various measures that can be taken to reduce the impact of such disclosure on the data subject's right to protection of their private life, including omitting names in the judgment, publishing an abridged version of the reasoning, restricting access to the judgment, and conducting an individualized assessment of proportionality.

"What factors should be considered in the assessment of requests for rectification of civil status registers to take into account the post-operative status of a transsexual person under Article 8, considering the coherency of administrative and legal practices within the domestic system as an important factor (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, § 78)?","The fact of imposing on an individual requesting rectification of his personal data in the official State registers a requirement which creates insurmountable barriers for him may prove incompatible with the State’ s obligation to guarantee effective respect for his private life ( Ciubotaru v. Moldova , 2010, § § 51-59).
In the context of requests for rectification of civil status registers to take into account the post- operative status of a transsexual person, the coherency of administrative and legal practices within the domestic system must be regarded as an important factor in the assessment of such requests carried out under Article 8 ( Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, § 78).
In a case concerning a refusal by the authorities to modify the birth register, the Court stated that it was struck by the fact that the gender reassignment which is lawfully provided is not met with full recognition in law, which might be regarded as the final and culminating step in the long and difficult process of transformation which the transsexual has undergone ( ibid. , § 78, rever sing its case -law to take account of developments in science and society since the time of such older judgments as Rees v. the United Kingdom , 1986, § § 42-44, Cossey v. the United Kingdom , 1990, § § 39-40, and Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom [GC], 1998, § § 60-61).
Where a State has author ised the treatment and surgery alleviating the condition of a transsexual, financed or assisted in financing the operations and indeed permits the artificial insemination of a woman living with a female -to-male transsexual, it appears illogical to refuse t o recognise the legal implications of the result to which the treatment leads (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, § 78), especially since the difficulties posed by the rectification of an initial gender entry in the birth register are far from insurmountable ( ibid. , § 91).",5,5,4,5,5,,guide_data_protection,"[290, 291, 292, 289, 344]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that should be considered in the assessment of requests for rectification of civil status registers to take into account the post-operative status of a transsexual person under Article 8.

Under what circumstances does the disclosure of personal information in court proceedings or divorce proceedings constitute a violation of the right to respect for private life under Article 8?,"In the case of M.P. v. Portugal , 2021, § § 48-49, the production by the applicant ’s ex -husband, without her consent, in the context of divorce proceedings, of electronic messages exchanged by his wife on a dating site to which she seemed to have given him access did not entail a violation of Article 8, as the Family Court had not ultimately taken them into account and public access to data in this type of procedure was, in any event, restricted.
In the case of L.L. v. France , 2006 (§ § 46), in which the judge had relied, on an alternative and secondary basis, in the framework of divorce proceedings, on private correspondence between a medical consultant and the applicant ’s general practitioner containing a confidential medical document, the fact that the judge or the investigating officer could have excluded the medical data in question from the reasoning of the judgment and still have arrived at the same conclusion was an important factor that should be taken into account.
The Court thus found a violation of Article 8 for example in the cases of Z v. Finland, 1997, §§ 113- 114, on account of the publication of the identity and HIV status of a woman in a judgment, delivered during criminal proceedings against her husband, which was reported on by the pr ess; L.L. v. France , 2006, §§ 32-48, for the reproduction in a divorce decree of an extract from a personal medical document ; I. v. Finland, 2008, §§ 35-49, for insufficient protection against unauthorised access to the medical file of an HIV -positive nurse ; C.C. v. Spain, 2009, §§ 26-41, for the publication of the applicant ’s identity in a judgment related to his HIV status ; P. and S. v. Poland, 2012, §§ 128-137, for the disclosure of information by a public hospital by a pregnant girl who wished to have an abortion after being raped ; Konovalova v. Russia , 2014, §§ 39-50, where the applicant had complained about having to give birth in front of medical students without her consent ; P.T. v. Republic of Moldova , 2020 (§ § 24- 33), for the unnecessary presence of sensitive medical data on a certificate intended for various uses ; Frâncu v. Romania, 2020 , § 52, for a refusal to grant a private hearing, in a corruption case against a mayor, on an application for release on health grounds ; and Y.G. v. Russia , 2022 , §§ 46-53, where the applicant complained that a database containing, in particular, his health data had been available for sale at a market .
It considered that the serious interference with her right to respect for her private life occasioned by the production in judicial proceedings, without her consent, of information concerning her state of health, would be further aggravated if the medical information in question were to be made accessible to the public after ten years ( ibid. , § 112).

What factors does the European Court of Human Rights consider in determining whether a restriction violates Article 18 of the Convention?,"Where a restriction pursues an ulterior purpose and a purpose prescribed by the Convention, the Court will determine which is predom inant.
A predominant purpose in this context is the one that truly actuated the authorities and which was the overriding focus of their efforts ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 303; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; and Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 211- 213).
In other words, if it is established that a restriction also p ursued an ulterior purpose, there will only be a breach of Article 18 if the ulterior purpose is predominant ( ibid. , § 318; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; and Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 211-213; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 199; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 314; Kogan and Others v. Russia , 2023, § 68).
Conversely, if the prescribed purpose was the main purpose, the one that truly actuated the authorities, though they also wanted to gain some other advantage, the restriction does not run counter to Article 18 (Merab ishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 305, and Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], § 165; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 199).
Article 18 is rarely invoked and there have been few cases where the Court declared a complaint under Article 18 admissible, let alone found a violation ( Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia , 2013, Guide on Article 18 of the Convention – Limitation on use of restrictions on rights § 898).
A violation of Article 18 can only arise where the right or freedom which has been interfered with is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention ( Kamma v. the Netherlands , Commission ’s report, 1974, p. 9; Oates v. Poland (dec.) , 2000 ; Gusinskiy v. Russia , 2004, § 73); in other words when it is a qualified right ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, §§ 265, 271 and 2 90; Mammadli v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 93; Rashad Hasanov and Others v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 116; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 164; Navalnyy v. Russia (no. 2) , 2019, § 84; Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia (no. 2) , 2020, § 620; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 421; Democracy and Human Rights Resource Centre and Mustafayev v. Azerbaijan , 2021, § 98; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 193; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 308; Kogan and Others v. Russia , 2023, § 67).
When considering an allegation under Article 18 , the Court must therefore establish: ▪ whether the restriction of the applicant ’s right or freedom was applied for an ulterior purpose; ▪ whether the restriction pursued both a purpose prescribed by the Convention and an ulterior one, that is, whether there was a plurality of purposes; ▪ which purpose was predominant ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 309).",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_18,"[44, 45, 46, 5, 17, 28, 38, 115]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the factors considered by the European Court of Human Rights in determining whether a restriction violates Article 18 of the Convention.

What is the standard of proof applied by the Court in assessing evidence and reaching conclusions in cases before it?,"The second aspect of the Court ’s approach is that the standard of proof before it is “beyond reasonable doubt”.
That standard is not co -extensive with that of the national legal systems which employ it.
Fir st, such proof can follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.
Secondly, the level of persuasion required to reach a conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity o f the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 314; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 215; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 202; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 316).
The third aspect of the Court ’s approach is that the Court is free to assess not only the admissibility and relevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it.
When assessing evidence it is not bound by formulae and adopts the conclusions supported by the free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 147).
It is sensitive to any potential evidentiary difficulties encountered by a party ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 315; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 215; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 202; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 316).
The Court will not restrict itself to direct proof in relation to complaints under Article 18 or apply a special standard of proof to such allegations ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, §§ 282 and 310; contrast Khodorkovskiy v. Russia , 2011, § 260; Dochnal v. Poland , 2012, § 116; Nastase v. Romania (dec.), 2014, § 109; OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia , 2011, § 603; Bîrsan v. Romania (dec.) , 2016, § 73; Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia , 2013, § 899; Mammadli v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 98; Rashad Hasanov and Others v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 120; Aliyev v. Azerbaijan , 2018, § 204; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 215; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422; Ahmet Hüsrev Altan v. Turkey , 2021, § 237; Kogan and Others v. Russia , 2023, § 68).
Indeed, depending on the circumstances of the case, an ulterior purpose cannot always be proved by pointing to a particularly inculpatory piece of evidence, which clearly reveals an actual reason behind the authorities ’ action (for example, a written document as in Gusinskiy v. Russia , 2004 ), or a specific isolated incident ( Mirgadirov v. Azerbaijan and Turkey , 2020, § 132) , or the fact that the applicant was interviewed in connection with events not related to the ongoing criminal case (Ugul ava v. Georgia , 2023, § 125; Kavala v. Turkey , 2019, § 222) .
Instead, it adheres to its usual approach to proof ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC], 2017, § 310; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422; and Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 202; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 316), rather than to the stricter standard that it had applied under this Article in a number of previous cases.
The first aspect of that approach is that, as a general rule, the burden of proof is not borne by one or other party be cause the Court examines all the material before it irrespective of its origin, and can obtain material of its own motion.
On a number of occasions, the Court has recognised that strictly following the approach whereby the burden of proof in relation to an allegation lies on the party which makes it is not possible, notably in instances where the applicants face specific evidentiary difficulties (Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 311; Ireland v. the United Kingdom , 1978, §§ 160-161; Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], 2001, §§ 112-113 and 115; Georgia v. Russia (I) [GC], 2014, §§ 93 and 95 ; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; Korban v. Ukraine , 2019, § 215; Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria , 2021, § 202; Juszczyszyn v. Poland , 2022, § 316).
The Court relies on the evidence which the parties adduce spontaneously, although it can of its own motion ask applicants or respondent Governments to provide material which can corroborate or refute the allegations made before it.
If the respondent Government in question do not accede to such a request, the Court can draw inferences if they do not duly account for their failure or refusal (Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], 2013, § 202).
Rule 44C § 1 of the Rules of Court allows it also to combine such inferences with contextual factors ( Merabishvili v. Georgia [GC] , 2017, § 312; Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], 2018, § 165; and Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], 2020, § 422).",5,5,4,5,4,,guide_art_18,"[98, 99, 100, 94, 95, 96]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the standard of proof applied by the Court in assessing evidence and reaching conclusions in cases before it.

"In determining whether a measure constitutes a deprivation of liberty, what factors should be taken into consideration by the Court, particularly in the context of confinement of foreigners in airport transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants?","In determining the distinction between a restriction on liberty of movement and deprivation of liberty in the context of confinement of foreigners in airport transit zones and reception centres for the identification and registration of migrants, the factors taken into consideration by the Court may be summarised as follows: i) the applicants ’ individual situation and their choices, ii) the applicable legal regime of the respective country and its purpose, iii) the relevant duration, especially in the light of the purpose and the procedural protection enjoyed by applicants pending t he events, and iv) the nature and degree of the actual restrictions imposed on or experienced by the applicants ( Z.A. and Others v. Russia [GC], 2019, § 138; Ilias and Ahmed v. Hungary [GC], 2019, § 217; R.R. and Others v. Hungary , 2021, § 74).
In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5, the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question ( De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], 2017, § 80; Guzzardi v. Italy , 1980, § 92; Medv edyev and Others v. France [GC], 2010, § 73; Creangă v. Romania [GC], 2012, § 91).
It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Conve ntion, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail ( Khlaifia and Others v.

"Under what circumstances can the obligation not to commit a criminal offense be considered sufficiently concrete and specific, and what factors should be taken into account in assessing the proportionality of an arrest in relation to the immediate fulfillment of the obligation?","The obligation not to commit a criminal offence can only be considered as “specific and concrete” if the place and time of the imminent commission of the offence and its potential victims have been sufficiently specified.
In the context of a duty to ref rain from doing something, as distinct from a duty to perform a specific act, it is necessary, prior to concluding that a person has failed to satisfy his obligation at issue, that the person concerned was made aware of the specific act which he or she was to refrain from committing and that the person showed himself or herself not to be willing to refrain from so doing ( Kurt v. Austria [GC], 2021, § 185; Ostendorf v. Germany , 2013, §§ 93-94).
The principle of proportionality further dictates that a balance must be struck between the importance in a democratic society of securing the immediate fulfilment of the obligation in question, and the importance of the right to liberty ( Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2008, § 70).
The domestic authorities must strike a fair balance between the importance in a democratic society of securing compliance with a lawful order of a court, and the importance of the right to liberty.
Factors to be taken into consideration include the purpose of the order, the feasibility of compliance with the order, and the duration of the detention.
The issue of proportionality assumes particular significance in the overall scheme of things ( Gatt v. Malta , 2010, § 40).",5,4,5,5,5,,guide_art_5,"[73, 74, 75, 69, 71, 81]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which the obligation not to commit a criminal offense can be considered sufficiently concrete and specific.

What information must be provided to arrested persons regarding the legal and factual grounds of their arrest in accordance with Article 5 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"However, a bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 § 2 (ibid. , § 41; Murray v. the United Kingdom [GC], 1994, § 76; Kortesis v. Greece , 2012, §§ 61-62).
Arrested persons must be told, in simple, non -technical language that they can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for the arrest, so as to be able, if they see fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 § 4 (Khlaifia and Others v.

Under what circumstances does force-feeding a prisoner on hunger strike in protest of prison conditions amount to torture under the European Convention on Human Rights?,"By contrast , the Court found that the force -feeding of a prisoner on hunger strike in protest of prison conditions was not prompted by valid medical reasons but rather with the aim of forcing him to stop his protest and performed in a manner which exposed him unnecessarily to great physical pain and humiliation amounted to torture ( Ciorap v. Moldova , 2007 , § 89; see also Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine , 2005, § 98).
More recently , the Court considered that the State authorities had failed to manage the applicant ’s protest hunger strike , given the lack of medical necessity for the force -feeding which took place shortly after the start of his hunger strike and given the absence of legal regulation and deficient procedural safeguards as to implementation.
In the absence of an investigation, the Court could not rule out that the aim of the force -feedin g at issue was to suppress the protests in that prison (Yakovlyev v. Ukraine ,2022, §§ 46-51).
the applicant, a detainee who was on hunger strike, was forced fed, despite the absence of medical necessity and with the use of handcuffs, a mouth -widener, a special rubber tube inserted into the food channel and, in the event of resistance, with the use of force (Nevmerzhitsky v.

Under what circumstances can force-feeding be justified as medical necessity and not violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"A measure which is a therapeutic necessity from the point of view of established principles of medicine cannot , in principle , be regarded as inhuman and degrading.
The Court must , nevertheless , satisfy itself that a medical necessity has bee n convincingly shown to exist and that procedural guarantees for the decision exist and are complied with ( Jalloh v. Germany [GC], 2006 , § 69).
Force -feeding that is aimed at saving the life of a detainee who consciously refuses to take food cannot in principle be regarded as inhuman and degrading.
Moreover, the manner in which the applicant is subjected to force -feeding during the hunger strike should not trespass the threshold of a minimum level of severity envisaged by the Court ’s case law under Article 3 of the Convention ( Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine , 2005 , § 94).
In Herczegfalvy v. Austria , 1992, which involved, inter a lia, the force -feeding of a psychiatric patient who refused to take food, the Court found the treatment justified by medical necessity and that therefore it did not violate Article 3 (§ § 79-84).
By contrast , the Court found that the force -feeding of a prisoner on hunger strike in protest of prison conditions was not prompted by valid medical reasons but rather with the aim of forcing him to stop his protest and performed in a manner which exposed him unnecessarily to great physical pain and humiliation amounted to torture ( Ciorap v.

"When determining whether the use of force resulting in the deprivation of life is justified under Article 2 of the Convention, how should the absolute necessity test be applied and what factors should be taken into account?","The use of force, however, must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in sub -paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) ( McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom , 1995, § 148; Yüksel Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey , 2007, § 86; Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC] , 2007, § 286; Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC] , 2011, § 17).
As a rule , the use of the term “absolutely necessary” in Article 2 § 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraph 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention.
In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub -paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c) ( McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom , 1995, § 149).
In this connection, it has underlined the need to differentiate between the political choices made in the course of fighting terrorism, that remain by their nature outside of such supervision, and other, more operational aspects of the authorities ’ actions that have a direct bearing on the protect ed rights.
Therefore, the absolute necessity test formulated in Article 2 is bound to be applied with different degrees of scrutiny, depending on whether and to what extent the authorities were in control of the situation and other relevant constraints inherent in operative decision -making in this sensitive sphere (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia , 2017, § 481).
The Court has emphasised on many occasions that Article 2 of the Convention may come into play even if a person whose right to life was allegedly breached did not die.
Thus, i t is of primary importance that the domestic regulations be guided by the same principle and contain clear indications to that extent, including the obligations to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm and exclude the use of weapons and ammunition that carry unwarranted consequences ( Tagayeva and Others v. Russia , 2017, § 595).
In keeping with the importance of this provision in a democratic society, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of the agents of the State who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination ( McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom , 1995, § 150; Ergi v. Turkey , 1998, § 79).
For example, the Court has underlined that the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity.
Therefore in principle there can be no such necessity where it is known that t he person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest t he individual concerned being lost ( Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC] , 2005, § 95; Kakoulli v. Turkey , 2005, § 108).",5,5,4,5,3,,guide_art_2,"[104, 105, 106, 4, 96, 108, 110]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the absolute necessity test should be applied when determining whether the use of force resulting in the deprivation of life is justified under Article 2 of the Convention.

"In what circumstances does the European Court of Human Rights consider an effective criminal investigation to be necessary to satisfy the requirement of Article 2 of the Convention, even in cases of non-intentional infringements of the right to life?","Such as for example:  in the context of dangerous industrial activities ( Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC] , 2004, § 71);  in the context of a denial of healthcare ( Asiye Genç v. Turkey , 2015, § 73);  in the context of military activities ( Oruk v. Turkey , 2014, §§ 50 and 65 );  in the context of transportation of dangerous goods ( Sinim v. Turkey , 2017, §§ 62-64);  in the context of road safety ( Smiljanić v. Croatia , 2021, § 93);  in the context of police inaction in a domestic violence case ( Tkhelidze v. Georgia , 2021, §§ 59-60; see also Penati v. Italy , 2021, §§ 158-162, where the Court has also required a criminal investigation into the killing of a child by his father during a protected contact session organized by the social welfare department ).
Likewise, the Court has admitted that, in cases where it is not clearly established from the outset that the death has resulted from an accident or another unintentional act, and where the hypothesis of unlawful killing is at least arguable on the facts, the Convention requires that an investigation which satisfies the minimum threshold of effectiveness be conducted in order to shed light on the circumstances of the death.
Since then the Court has accepted that this obligation arises in a variety of situations where an individual has sustained life -threatening injuries, died or has disappeared in violent or suspicious circumstances, irrespective of whether those allegedly responsible are State agents or private persons or are unknown or self- inflicted (see, for example, concerning inter -prisoner violence : Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 69; concerning homicides by prisoners benefiting from early release or social re -integration schemes : Maiorano and Others v. Italy , 2009, §§ 123-26; concerning high -profile assassinations : Kolevi v. Bulgaria, 2009, §§ 191-215; concerning domestic violence : Opuz v. Turkey , 2009, § 150; concerning suspicious deaths or disappearances : Iorga v. Moldova , 2010, § 26; Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC] , 2004, § 226; concerning suicide : Trubnikov v. Russia , 2005 ; Mosendz v. Ukraine , 2013, § 92; Vasîlca v. the Republic of Moldova, 2014, § 28).
This stems from Article 2 which imposes a duty on that State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law -enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provis ions.
This obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when there is reason to believe that an individual has sustained life -threatening injuries in suspicious circumstances, even where the presumed perpetrator of the fatal attack is not a State agent ( Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC] , 2015, § 171).",5,5,4,5,5,,guide_art_2,"[213, 214, 215, 144, 147, 148, 205]",sentence-level-cot-with-search,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive list of circumstances in which the European Court of Human Rights considers an effective criminal investigation to be necessary to satisfy the requirement of Article 2 of the Convention, even in cases of non-intentional infringements of the right to life.

It also mentions that the obligation for an effective investigation arises in various situations where an individual has sustained life-threatening injuries, died, or disappeared in violent or suspicious circumstances.

"In which case did the European Court of Human Rights hold that granting an amnesty to a perpetrator of sexual assault was in breach of the positive obligation under both Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention?

"According to the ECHR case law, what must domestic law provide in order to ensure individuals the minimum degree of protection for their rights under the rule of law in a democratic society?","The clarity requirement applies to the scope of discretion exercised by public authorities (see, for instance, Lia v. Malta, 2022, §§ 56-57). Domestic law must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure to individuals the minimum degree of protection to which they are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (Piechowicz v. Poland, 2012, § 212). In Lia v. Malta, 2022, the Court held that an interference with the applicants’ Article 8 rights, occasioned by the denial of access to IVF on account of the second applicant’s age, was not in accordance with the law. According to the law, it was “desirable” that the woman be between 25 and 42 and the courts appeared to accept that this provision allowed for flexibility. However, the authority had treated the upper age-limit as mandatory. According to the Court, at the relevant time, the manner in which the provision had been interpreted by the judicial and administrative authorities was “incoherent” (§ 67).

"What does the ""in accordance with the law"" phrase imply in terms of domestic law and its impact on individuals' rights under the Convention?","With regard to foreseeability, the phrase “in accordance with the law” thus implies, inter alia, that domestic law must be sufficiently foreseeable in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which, and the conditions on which, the authorities are entitled to resort to measures affecting their rights under the Convention (Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], 2014, § 117). Foreseeability need not be certain. In Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], 2003, the applicants must have been able to foresee to a reasonable degree, at least with the advice of legal experts, that they would be regarded as covered by the law (see also Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC], 2016, § 171). Absolute certainty in this matter could not be expected (§ 107). It should also be noted that the applicant’s profession may be a factor to consider as it provides an indication as to his or her ability to foresee the legal consequences of his or her actions (Versini-Campinchi and Crasnianski v. France, 2016, § 55). In determining whether the applicable law could be considered as foreseeable in its consequences and as enabling the applicant to regulate his conduct in his specific case, the Court may be confronted with a situation of divergences in the case-law of different courts at the same level of jurisdiction (Klaus Müller v.

What was the reason for the Court finding a violation of the right to private life in the case of Söderman v. Sweden?,"A State’s responsibility to protect private and family life often includes positive obligations that ensure adequate regard for Article 8 rights at the national level. The Court, for example, found a violation of the right to private life due to the absence of clear statutory provisions criminalising the act of covertly filming a naked child (Söderman v. Sweden [GC], 2013, § 117). Similarly, in a case concerning an identity check, the Court found that, without any legislative requirement of a real restriction or review of either the authorisation of an enhanced check or the police measures carried out during an enhanced check, domestic law did not provide adequate safeguards to offer the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (Vig v. Hungary, 2021, § 62). In the absence of any real restriction or review of either the authorisation of an enhanced check or the police measures carried out during an enhanced check, the Court is of the view that the domestic law did not provide adequate safeguards to offer the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference. Therefore, the measures complained of were not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.

"What factors are taken into account when determining the breadth of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by States in implementing their positive obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?
    ","As in the case of negative obligations, in implementing their positive obligations under Article 8, the States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. A number of factors must be taken into account when determining the breadth of that margin (see, for instance, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen v. Finland [GC], 2014, \u00a7 67 and Maurice v. France [GC], 2005, \u00a7 117). Where a particularly important facet of an individual\u2019s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will be restricted (for example, X and Y v. the Netherlands, 1985, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 27; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, \u00a7 90; Pretty v. the United Kingdom, 2002, \u00a7 71). Where, however, there is no consensus within the Member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, 1997, \u00a7 44; Frett\u00e9 v. France, 2002, \u00a7 41; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2002, \u00a7 85). There will also often be a wider margin if the State is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (Frett\u00e9 v. France, 2002, \u00a7 42; Odi\u00e8vre v. France [GC], 2003, \u00a7\u00a7 44-49; Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2007, \u00a7 77; Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2007, \u00a7 78; S.H. and Others v. Austria [GC], 2011, \u00a7 94). Special weight has to be accorded to the role of the domestic policy-maker in matters of general policy on which opinions within a democratic society could reasonably differ widely. This is particularly true where the question is one on which society would have to make a choice (Y v. France, 2023, \u00a7 90).",4,5,4,3,4,It is not the best summary on how margin is applied,guide_art_8_eng,[8],single-paragraph,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that are taken into account when determining the breadth of the margin of appreciation enjoyed by States in implementing their positive obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

What approach does the European Court of Human Rights take when evaluating measures that interfere with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?,"In some cases, the Court found that the impugned measure did not have a rational basis or connection to any of the legitimate aims foreseen in Article 8 § 2, which was in itself sufficient for a violation of the Article. Nevertheless, the Court considered that the interference raised such a serious issue of proportionality to any possible legitimate aim that it also examined this aspect (Mozer v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], 2016, §§ 194-196; P.T. v. the Republic of Moldova, 2020, §§ 30- 33). The Court may also find it unnecessary to take a definitive stance on whether the disputed measure in fact pursued any of the indicated legitimate aims because it found that the measure was not necessary in a democratic society (see for instance, Chocholáč v.

What is the significance of the Court's case-law on Articles 3 and 8 with regard to the protection of vulnerable children and the prohibition of corporal punishment in Germany?,"In its case-law on Articles 3 and 8, the Court emphasised the importance to children and the other vulnerable members of society of benefiting from State protection where their physical and mental well-being were threatened (Wetjen and Others v. Germany, 2018, § 74, Tlapak and Others v. Germany, 2018, § 87; A and B v. Croatia, 2019, §§ 106-113). The Court found a breach of both of these Articles given the failure to protect the personal integrity of a vulnerable child in the course of excessively long criminal proceedings relating to sexual abuse, which it considered to be a serious case of secondary victimisation (N.Ç. v. Turkey, 2021). In the two cases against Germany, the Court reiterated that the fact of regularly caning one’s children was liable to attain the requisite level of severity to fall foul of Article 3 (Wetjen and Others v. Germany, 2018, § 76; Tlapak and Others 1 See the Case-law Guide on Article 2 (Right to life). 2 See the Case-law Guide on Article 3 (Prohibition of torture). v. Germany, 2018, § 89). Accordingly, in order to prevent any risk of ill-treatment under Article 3, the Court considered it commendable if Member States prohibited in law all forms of corporal punishment of children. However, in order to ensure compliance with Article 8, such a prohibition should be implemented by means of proportionate measures so that it was practical and effective and did not remain theoretical (Wetjen and Others v. Germany, 2018, §§ 77-78; Tlapak and Others v. Germany, 2018, §§ 90-91).

What standard does the Court apply to the decision-making process leading to measures of interference in cases involving family life under Article 8?,"However, in some cases where family life is at stake and the applicants invoked Articles 6 and 8, the Court has decided to examine the facts solely under Article 8 (see, for instance, T.C. v. Italy, 2022, § 53). According to the Court, the procedural aspect of Article 8 requires the decision-making process leading to measures of interference to be fair and to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by the Article (Soares de Melo v. Portugal, 2016, § 65; Santos Nunes v. Portugal, 2012, § 56; Havelka and Others v. the Czech Republic, 2007, §§ 34-35; Wallová and Walla v. the Czech Republic, 2006, § 47; Kutzner v. Germany, 2002, § 56; McMichael v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 87; and Mehmet Ulusoy and Others v. Turkey, 2019, § 109). Therefore, the Court may also have regard, under Article 8, to the form and length of the decision-making process (T.C. v. Italy, 2022, § 57; Macready v. the Czech Republic, 2010, § 41; and for special attention and priority treatment called for in the context of sexual abuse in order to ensure the protection of the child, see N.Ç. v.

What types of obligations may be imposed on authorities under Article 8 of the Convention to protect the physical and psychological integrity of an individual from acts of violence by private individuals?,"The Court indicated for the first time that the concept of private life covered the physical and moral integrity of the person in X and Y v. the Netherlands, 1985, \u00a7 22. That case concerned the sexual assault of a mentally disabled sixteen-year old girl and the absence of criminal law provisions to provide her with effective and practical protection (see, more recently, Vav\u0159i\u010dka and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], 2021, \u00a7 261). A person\u2019s body concerns the most intimate aspect of private life (Y.F. v. Turkey, 2003, \u00a7 33). Regarding the protection of the physical and psychological integrity of an individual from other persons, the Court has held that the authorities\u2019 positive obligations \u2013 in some cases under Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention and in other instances under Article 8 taken alone or in combination with Article 3 (ibid.) \u2013 may include a duty to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection against acts of violence by private individuals (Osman v. the United Kingdom, 1998, \u00a7\u00a7 128-130; Bevacqua and S. v. Bulgaria, 2008, \u00a7 65; Sandra Jankovi\u0107 v. Croatia, 2009, \u00a7 45; A v. Croatia, 2010, \u00a7 60; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 v. Croatia, 2012, \u00a7\u00a7 141-143; S\u00f6derman v. Sweden [GC], 2013, \u00a7 80). Furthermore, that legal framework must be implemented effectively in practice in order for the State to comply with its positive obligations under Article 8 (\u0160padijer v. Montenegro, 2021, \u00a7 101). For a recapitulation of the case-law and the limits of the applicability of Article 8 in this context, see Nicolae Virgiliu T\u0103nase v. Romania [GC], 2019, \u00a7\u00a7 125-132. In this case, the Court found Article 8 not applicable to a road-traffic accident which did not occur as the result of an act of violence intended to cause harm to the applicant\u2019s physical and psychological integrity (\u00a7\u00a7 129-132).

What was the Court's finding in the case of Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania regarding the authorities' failure to prosecute individuals who posted hateful comments against the applicants on a public Facebook page?,"In Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania, 2020, the applicants, two young men, posted a photograph of themselves kissing on a public Facebook page. This online post received hundreds of virulently homophobic comments. Although the applicants requested it, the prosecutors and domestic courts refused to prosecute, finding that the applicants’ behaviour had been “eccentric” and did not correspond to “traditional family values” in the country. The Court stated that the hateful comments against the applicants and the homosexual community in general were instigated by a bigoted attitude towards that community and that the very same discriminatory state of mind was at the core of the failure on the part of the relevant public authorities to discharge their positive obligation to investigate in an effective manner whether those comments constituted incitement to hatred and violence. The Court concluded that the applicants had suffered discrimination on the ground of their sexual orientation (§§ 106-116, § 129). In Association ACCEPT and Others v. Romania, 2021, the Court reiterated the obligation on the authorities’ part to offer adequate protection in respect of the applicants’ dignity (§ 127). As a matter of principle, in Oganezova v. Armenia, 2022, the Court recalled the authorities’ duty to prevent hate-motivated violence on the part of private individuals as well as to investigate the existence of a possible link between a discriminatory motive and the act of violence (whether physical or verbal) could constitute positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 and could also be seen to as part of the authorities’ positive responsibilities under Article 14 of the Convention to secure the fundamental values protected by Articles 3 and 8 without discrimination. In Nepomnyashchiy and Others v. Russia, 2023, the applicants, members of the LGBTI community, complained about negative public statements made by public officials about the LGBTI community. The Court found that the applicants may claim to be victims despite the fact that they had not been directly targeted by the contested statements (§ 57). Bearing in mind the history of public hostility towards the LGBTI community in Russia and the increase in homophobic hate crimes, including violent crimes, at the material time, the openly homophobic content and particularly aggressive and hostile tone of the statements, as well as the fact that they were made by influential public figures holding official posts and were published in popular newspapers with a large readership, the Court considered that the contested statements reached the “threshold of severity” required to be considered to affect the “private life” of members of the group (§§ 59-62).

"How does the European Court of Human Rights define the word ""dispute"" in the context of Article 6 § 1, and what factors are considered in determining whether a proceeding falls within its scope?","The word “dispute” must be given a substantive meaning rather than a formal one (Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 1981, § 45; Moreira de Azevedo v. Portugal, 1990, § 66; Miessen v. Belgium, 2016, § 43).

Greece (no. 2) [GC], 2009, § 29; Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], 2012, § 92). Thus, proceedings containing a mixture of contentious and non-contentious aspects may fall within the scope of Article 6 § 1 (Omdahl v.

What is the obligation of states towards life prisoners in terms of rehabilitation and what kind of prison regimes should be provided to enable their progress towards rehabilitation?,"More recently the Court noted that the emphasis in European penal policy was on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, even in the case of life prisoners. Thus, for instance, in circumstances where a Government seek to rely solely on the risk posed by offenders to the public in order to justify their continued detention, regard must be had to the need to encourage the rehabilitation of those offenders. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, a right to rehabilitation, the Court’s case-law presupposes that convicted persons, including life prisoners, should be allowed to rehabilitate themselves. Even though States are not responsible for achieving the rehabilitation of life prisoners, they nevertheless have a duty to make it possible for such prisoners to rehabilitate themselves. This is to be seen as an obligation of means, not one of result. However, it entails a positive obligation to secure prison regimes to life prisoners which are compatible with the aim of rehabilitation and enable such prisoners to make progress towards their rehabilitation (Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], 2016, §§ 101-104).",4,5,5,4,5,,guide_prisoners_rights_eng,[11],single-paragraph,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the obligation of states towards life prisoners in terms of rehabilitation and the kind of prison regimes that should be provided to enable their progress towards rehabilitation.

This was the first case in which a respondent State had relied on international law to request the Court to find inapplicable its obligations under Article 5 of the Convention or, failing that, to interpret them in the light of the powers of detention conferred on it by international humanitarian law. The Court unanimously found that the victim had been within the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction rather than that of the United States, as contended by the British Government. The Court rejected the latter’s submissions denying the application of any jurisdiction during the active hostilities phase of an international armed conflict, when the agents of the Contracting State are acting within a territory of which the latter is not the occupying power and the conduct of the Contracting State is instead governed by the provisions of international humanitarian law. The Court considered that such a conclusion would be contrary to its previous case-law. It also held that even after the area in question had been transferred from British to US authority, the United Kingdom had retained authority and control over all the aspects of the complaints raised by the applicant.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_1_eng,[137],single-paragraph,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the Court's findings regarding the United Kingdom's jurisdiction over the capture and detention of the Iraqi national during the hostilities in 2003.

The Court found no violation of Article 3, inter alia, it considered that the applicant’s claim concerning the homosexual relationship, which had been made at a later stage, was not credible, as no plausible explanation had been given for the delay in making such claims both domestically and before the Court.

"How does the European Court of Human Rights determine whether an applicant is ""lawfully within the territory of a State"" and to what extent is it bound by the findings of domestic courts in making this determination?","In determining whether an applicant is “lawfully within the territory of a State”, the Court has regard to the relevant findings of the domestic courts (M.S. v. Belgium, 2012, § 196; Piermont v. France, 1995, § 49). It is, however, not bound by them and, if needed, will assess whether domestic decisions have sufficient legal and factual basis (Tatishvili v. Russia, 2007, § 43) and whether they disclose any appearance of arbitrariness (Omwenyeke v. Germany (dec.), 2007). For instance, in Tatishvili v. Russia, 2007, the Court found, contrary to the domestic authorities’ claim and the respondent Government’s submissions, that the applicant was neither a foreign citizen nor a stateless person and did not therefore require a visa or a residence permit. It established, on the basis of the relevant legislation, that, at the material time, she had had a special legal status, that of a “citizen of the former USSR”, and was therefore lawfully present in Russia (§§ 39-43).",4,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_2_protocol_4_eng,[32],single-paragraph,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the European Court of Human Rights determines whether an applicant is ""lawfully within the territory of a State"" and the extent to which it is bound by the findings of domestic courts in making this determination.

How does the European Court of Human Rights determine whether the exercise of the right to appeal infringes upon an individual's right to liberty?,"According to the Court’s case-law, the exercise of the right of appeal cannot be hindered by attaching any de facto adverse effects to an accused for exercising his or her right of appeal (Ruslan Yakovenko v. Ukraine, 2015, §§ 79-83). In the cited case, the domestic courts considered it necessary to keep the applicant in detention as a preventive measure until the first-instance court’s judgment became final, even after the prison sentence imposed on him by that judgment had already expired. In the absence of an appeal, the period in question lasted for twelve days. Had the applicant decided to appeal, this would have delayed his release for an unspecified period of time after the judgment became final. In these circumstances, the Court found that the applicant’s exercise of his right to appeal would have come at the cost of his liberty, particularly as the length of his detention during the appeal would have been uncertain, therefore infringing the very essence of his right in violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.",5,5,5,5,5,,guide_art_2_protocol_7_eng,[25],single-paragraph,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Comprehensiveness Analysis: The answer provides a clear explanation of how the European Court of Human Rights determines whether the exercise of the right to appeal infringes upon an individual's right to liberty.

What are the key requirements for national law in relation to the scope of discretion for public authorities and the clarity of measures of secret surveillance and collection of data?,"The national law must be clear, foreseeable, and adequately accessible (Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1983, \u00a7 87; for an instruction issued by the Chief Prosecutor, see Vasil Vasilev v. Bulgaria, 2021, \u00a7\u00a7 92-94; for instructions issued by the Ministry of Justice, see Nuh Uzun and Others v. Turkey, 2022, \u00a7 83-99). It must be sufficiently foreseeable to enable individuals to act in accordance with the law (Lebois v. Bulgaria, 2017, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67 with further references therein, as regards internal orders in prison), and it must demarcate clearly the scope of discretion for public authorities. For example, as the Court articulated in the surveillance context (see the outline of the requirements in Falzarano v. Italy (dec.), 2021, \u00a7\u00a7 27-29), the law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which the authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of secret surveillance and collection of data (Shimovolos v. Russia, 2011, \u00a7 68). In Vukota-Boji\u0107 v. Switzerland, 2016, the Court found a violation of Article 8 due to the lack of clarity and precision in the domestic legal provisions that had served as the legal basis of the applicant\u2019s surveillance by her insurance company after an accident. In Glukhin v. Russia, 2023 (\u00a7\u00a7 82- 83), the Court expressed strong doubts that the domestic legal provisions which authorised the processing of biometric personal data, including with the aid of facial recognition technology, \u201cin connection with the administration of justice\u201d met the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement since they were widely formulated and would appear to allow the processing of such data in connection with any type of judicial proceedings. For the \u201cquality of law\u201d requirement to be met in the context of implementing facial recognition technology, it was essential to have detailed rules governing the scope and application of measures as well as strong safeguards against the risk of abuse and arbitrariness. The need for safeguards will be all the greater where the use of live facial recognition technology is concerned.

"Under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7, does the right of appeal apply to decisions that do not involve a formal finding of guilt or penalty, such as acquittals or other non-conviction decisions?","Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 applies in the case of a “conviction” or a “sentence”. This provision does not guarantee the right of appeal against an acquittal or any other decision, which does not constitute a formal finding of guilt or imposition of a penalty: the existence of a formal finding of guilt ending in a conviction or a sentence is a precondition for the application of the guarantees of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7. Such a finding must be the object and result of the proceedings and may not always entail the imposition of penalty. As a rule, it must be mentioned in the operative part of a verdict. In any event, the decisive factor must be whether a particular decision was aimed at finding a person guilty of a crime (Rybka v. Ukraine (dec.), 2009). However, in the circumstances of a particular case, an applicant may complain alternatively about his or her “conviction” or some aspects of the “conviction” (for instance, Rostovtsev v. Ukraine, 2017, § 30) or about the “sentence”, including the modalities of its execution (for instance, Tsvetkova and Others v. Russia, 2018, §§ 179- 191; and Martynyuk v.

Initially, the Court carried out a separate examination of the complaints brought before it under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention, while observing that its finding of procedural unfairness in the summary proceedings for contempt only served to compound the lack of proportionality (Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], 2005, § 181). More recently, it held that in the light of the shortcomings in the proceedings in question (resulting in a finding of a violation of Article 6 § 1), the restriction of the applicant’s right to freedom of expression had not been accompanied by effective and “adequate safeguards” against abuse and had therefore not been necessary in a democratic society, thus breaching Article 10 (Słomka v.

How did the Court determine that the expulsion in the Čonka v. Belgium case violated Article 4 of Protocol No 4?,"In Čonka v.

In those circumstances and in view of the large number of persons of the same origin who had suffered the same fate as the applicants, the Court considered that the procedure followed did not enable it to eliminate all doubt that the expulsion might have been collective. That doubt was reinforced by a series of factors: firstly, prior to the applicants’ deportation, the political authorities concerned had announced that there would be operations of that kind and given instructions to the relevant authority for their implementation; secondly, all the aliens concerned had been required to attend the police station at the same time; thirdly, the orders served on them requiring them to leave the territory and for their arrest had been couched in identical terms; fourthly, it had been very difficult for the aliens to contact a lawyer; lastly, the asylum procedure had not been completed. In short, at no stage during the period between the service of the notice on the aliens to attend the police station and their expulsion had the procedure afforded sufficient guarantees demonstrating that the personal circumstances of each of those concerned had been genuinely and individually taken into account.
